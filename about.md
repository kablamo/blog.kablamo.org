Hi I'm Eric.  I build things with Perl.  Perl is awesome.  I've been building
things with Perl for 14 years.  Currently I'm building things at
DuckDuckGo.  [DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com) is awesome.

Few things excite me more than concise, readable, well organized code with an
intuitive and forgiving api -- except for ice cream and peanut butter and
peanut butter ice cream.  

I like to travel too.  (Its awesome.)  I've lived and worked in Minneapolis,
Beijing, Singapore, London and am currently based in Chicago.
