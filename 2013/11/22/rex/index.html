    <p>I have recently been playing with <a href="http://www.rexify.org/">Rex</a> and wanted to
write down some of my initial thoughts.</p>

<p>Rex is a devops tool that helps you manage your servers.  Its similar to
Puppet Lab’s <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/mcollective">mcollective</a> tool or
<a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/">ansible</a>.  You can easily run commands on
your entire fleet of boxen or just on certain subgroups.  And you can run
them in parallel which saves you giant baskets of time.</p>

<p>The big advantage for People Who Prefer Perl (PWPP) is that Rex is written and
configured with Perl. So for the most part you don’t need to spend a lot of time
learning yet another DSL.</p>

<p>Another happy positive is that you don’t need to install any software on your
servers. Installation is simple:</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install libssh2-1-dev
$ cpanm Rex
</code></pre>

<p>Configuration is also simple – at least if you know Perl.  The
Rex configuration file is named ‘Rexfile’ and its syntax is Perl with some
extra Rexy sugar methods thrown in. And I feel the sugar and general API for
Rex is fairly well done.  Here is an example Rexfile:</p>

<pre><code># Configure the default user and your ssh keys.  The default user can be
# overridden on the command line with the -u option.
user "joe";
private_key "/home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa";
public_key "/home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub";
key_auth;

# Cofigure server groups
group prod =&gt; "webserver", "mailserver", "dbserver";
group dev  =&gt; "pancake[1-3]", "narwhale[1-3]", "honeybadger[1-3]";

# Run commands in parallel on up to 100 servers at one time.  This can be
# overridden on the command line with the -t option.
parallelism 100;

# Create tasks.  This task runs against all servers by default.  This can
# be overridden on the command line with the -G or -H options.
task 'uptime', group =&gt; 'all', sub {
    my $output = run "uptime";
    say $output;
};
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that Perl’s ‘say’ command is available by default.  ‘run’ is a Rex
sugar method which accepts a shell command and returns the output – similar
to Capture::Tiny.</p>

<p>Here is a command line example which runs the ‘uptime’ task as the ‘root’ user
on each server in the ‘dev’ group:</p>

<pre><code>$ rex -G dev -u root uptime
    pancake1:  16:42:05 up 221 days,  9:49,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale2:  16:42:05 up 8 days,  3:28,  4 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale3:  16:42:05 up 17 days,  3:57,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.01, 0.00
honeybadger1:  16:42:05 up 80 days,  3:29,  1 user,  load average: 0.09, 0.06, 0.01
    pancake3:  16:42:05 up 137 days,  7:49,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale1:  16:42:05 up 65 days,  5:30,  2 users,  load average: 0.46, 0.41, 0.37
honeybadger3:  16:42:04 up 15 days,  4:49,  1 user,  load average: 2.00, 2.00, 2.00
    pancake2:  16:42:04 up 1 day,  2:23,  3 users,  load average: 1.38, 1.35, 1.30
honeybadger2:  16:42:05 up 39 days,  1:24,  1 user,  load average: 0.08, 0.06, 0.01
</code></pre>

<p>Rex is fantastic for ad-hoc commands.  But it also has a great set of libraries
for doing much more like installing debian packages, user management,
virtualization, and managing EC2 boxes.  I have to say I’m deeply attracted to
its simplicity – especially after dealing with Puppet’s complicated and weird
DSL.</p>

<p>If anyone uses Rex to manage more than 50 servers, I would love to get in touch
with you and ask a few questions.</p>
