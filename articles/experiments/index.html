                <ul>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to buy.</strong>  Especially when I end up only using things
once or twice like books, dvds, dress shoes, and ties.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to store.</strong>  One time I had to rent a storage locker
because I couldn&rsquo;t take my things when I moved to China.  Some people get
big houses with walk in closets and a three car garage.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to maintain.</strong>  Broken stuff needs to be fixed.  Owning
a house means I need to fix the roof. Owning a car means I need to change
the tires.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is time consuming to maintain.</strong>  I have to dust my stuff.
A bigger house means more sweeping.
A bigger yard means more mowing. Owning a car means cleaning it and
changing the oil and scraping ice off the windows.<br>
I need to go to the store to find replacement parts,
batteries, light bulbs, cleaning supplies, and duct tape.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is stressful to own.</strong>  I might
lose it or dent it or scratch it or drop it or step on it.  Or it might
catch on fire.  Or someone might steal it.  Sometimes I get so stressed I buy
insurance for my stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff reduces my freedom.</strong>  Its hard to move to new place because I have
to carry all my stuff with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore I have decided to live with less stuff.  So I hereby declare war on
my stuff.  And also on my things.  Here is my 4 point plan to free myself from
the tedious tyranny of too many things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Point 1:</strong> Keep a comprehensive inventory of all my stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Point 2:</strong> Ruthlessly reduce the number of things in my inventory to less than 200.</li>
<li><strong>Point 3:</strong> No new stuff unless I throw out some old stuff first.</li>
<li><strong>Point 4:</strong> Have a beer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were hard core I would throw out everything I didn&rsquo;t use in the last 6
months.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll be hard core at some point in the future.</p>
