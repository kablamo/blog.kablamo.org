            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a> for a
couple years.  It&rsquo;s a powerful way to automate CPAN releases.</p>
<p>But learning how to use it was not as easy as I hoped.</p>
<p>I remember when <code>Dist::Zilla</code> first debuted.  It was very exciting.  But I think
I may have drank too much of the cool aid becuase my expectations were very
high when I finally sat down to learn it.  I expected my experience to be
composed entirely of rainbows and puppy dog tails.</p>
<h2 id="writing-your-own-distini-or-pluginbundle-is-hard">Writing your own dist.ini or PluginBundle is hard</h2>
<p>Instead I found that creating a dist.ini or PluginBundle is fairly hard.  There
are a huge number of plugins and it&rsquo;s difficult for a newcomer to know which
are old, which are new, and how they work together.  If you look, for example,
at <code>Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN</code> it uses 23 different plugins and the
<em>synopsis</em> is 132 lines long.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it was not reasonable to expect I could build something
comparable after a few minutes of perusing the docs.  It&rsquo;s more complex than
that.  So if you are looking to quickly add <code>Dist::Zilla</code> to your toolchain, you
need to use a PluginBundle and not write your own.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-quickly-add-distzilla-to-your-toolchain">How to quickly add Dist::Zilla to your toolchain</h2>
<p>One way is to just use <code>Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Basic</code>.  But this was not like
the promised land I had been dreaming of.  I wanted more.  So I kept looking.</p>
<p>Happily, there is a PluginBundle which I think works well as a reusable
component suitable for public consumption thats also very configurable.  I
doubt it&rsquo;s well known because the name sounds very personal.  That module is,
of course,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN">Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN</a>.</p>
<p>I think the workflow it uses will work for many people.  Even if it
doesn&rsquo;t, reading the code is a great way to learn how to write your own
PluginBundle.  And because it&rsquo;s so comprehensive it&rsquo;s like having a up-to-date
map of the state of the art in <code>Dist::Zilla</code> plugins and how they work
together.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what my dist.ini looks like:</p>
<pre><code>name    = App-Git-Ribbon
author  = Eric Johnson &lt;cpan at iijo dot nospamthanks dot org&gt;
license = Perl_5

main_module = lib/App/Git/Ribbon.pm
