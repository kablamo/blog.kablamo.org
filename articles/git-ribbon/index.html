            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I wrote a little Perl script called
<a href="https://github.com/kablamo/git-ribbon">git-ribbon</a> to help me review the
latest changes in a git repository.</p>
<p>The way I used to review changes was by reading through the <code>git log</code>.  I try
to do this every morning at work to keep up with whats going on.  But I was
having a few problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its hard to know exactly which changes are new.</li>
<li>I want to review commits in the order they happened (instead of most recent first).</li>
<li><code>git log</code> diff output can be hard to read and may not have enough context
&ndash; sometimes I want a side by side diff like I get from <code>vimdiff</code> or <code>git difftool</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically I wanted a quick and easy way to review the latest changes in a way
that feels a little more like an RSS feed.  So I wrote this script.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-git-ribbon">How to use git-ribbon</h2>
<p><strong>First</strong> mark your current place in the commit history.  This command will
place a tag named _ribbon at origin/master.  Basically its a bookmark at your
current location.</p>
<pre><code>⚡ git ribbon --save
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Next</strong>, pull the latest changes made by your fellow conspirators from the
remote repository.</p>
<pre><code>⚡ git pull
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Then</strong> use <code>git ribbon</code> to review only the changes that have occurred since _ribbon:</p>
<pre><code>⚡ git ribbon

</code></pre>
<p>The script will pause and wait for input when it prints <code>press 's' to skip</code>.
If you type anything other than <code>s</code>, it will show you the side by side diff
using <code>git difftool</code>.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8457314152_7f8b3c955c_b.jpg" title="click to view large version"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8457314152_7f8b3c955c.jpg" width="500" height="201" alt="vimdiff"></a></p>
<p>After you have reviewed all the changes, be sure to mark your place again so
its ready to go next time you want to do a pull:</p>
<pre><code>git ribbon --save
</code></pre>
<h2 id="bonus-tips">Bonus tips</h2>
<p>In your .gitconfig try this:</p>
<pre><code>[diff]
    tool = vimdiff
</code></pre>
<p>The default colors for vimdiff look like they were created by strange clowns so
try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>⚡ mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/
⚡ wget https://github.com/kablamo/dotfiles/blob/master/links/.vim/colors/iijo.vim -O ~/.vim/colors/iijo.vim
⚡ echo &quot;colorscheme iijo&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.vimrc
</code></pre>
<p>Then learn to use vimdiff:</p>
<ul>
<li>To switch windows type <code>ctl-w l</code> and <code>ctl-w h</code>.
For more help type <code>:help window-move-cursor</code>.</li>
<li>To open and close folds type <code>zo</code> and <code>zc</code>.
For more help type <code>:help fold-commands</code>.</li>
<li>To close vimdiff with less typing try <code>ZZ</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-vimdiff">Alternatives to vimdiff</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to invest the time just yet to learn vim, use an alternative like meld, opendiff,
p4merge, xxdiff, etc.  Side by side diffs are worth it!</p>
<h2 id="see-also">See also</h2>
<p>This script was inspired by a great <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2011/10/21/ribbon-and-catchup-reading-new-commits.html">blog
post</a>
on gitready.com which has a number of awesome git tricks for both beginners and
advanced users.</p>
<p>I also ended up writing a <a href="https://github.com/kablamo/vim-ribbon">vim plugin</a>
that is probably better user experience if you very comfortable in vim.</p>
