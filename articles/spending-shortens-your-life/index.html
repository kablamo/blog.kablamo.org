<p>One morning you awake to find the tooth fairy made an accounting error in
your favor.  She left $15 million under your pillow.  Now you
have some choices to make.  Here is one: Would you continue to wake
up each day and go to your current job?</p>
<p>We all have a certain amount of time to live.  Every dollar we earn is
given in exchange for time spent working.  So whenever we buy a car
or underwear or peanut butter we are paying in dollars but those dollars
represent time.  In a very real sense, buying stuff shortens your
life.  And btw that means a charitible donation is literally giving
part of your life to another, taxes are the government redistributing
life, national debt shortens the life of people of the future, etc,
etc.</p>
<p>The most common response to this problem is: Find a job you love.  This
is good advice.  The more pleasant your job is, the lower the
opportunity cost.  But think about the tooth fairy test.
There arent very many jobs out there that are going to pass
that test.  And unless you love your job enough that you would do it
even if you were financially independent &ndash; then you are still selling
away large pieces of your life.</p>
<p>There is only one escape: save enough money to live off the returns from
your investments.  Reach this goal and you will never again need to
trade your time for food and housing.</p>
