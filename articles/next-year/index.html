            <div class="post-content">
                <ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Spend less than $36,500 in 2017.</strong> If I can keep my spending at this level
I should be on my way to a long term goal of being financially
independent at age 42.  We spent about $45,000 in 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build a portfolio of airline miles and hotel points by travel hacking
credit cards.</strong> This could save me $4,000 a year or more in annual plane
tickets and hotels for a family of 3 to travel to Singapore.  We go every year
to visit my wife&rsquo;s family.  I completed a free 15 day email course at
<a href="https://travelmiles101.com">travelmiles101.com</a> and I can&rsquo;t recommend that
enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help my wife get her license.</strong> Time is the most valuable thing.  It would
be way more efficient if I can do chores while my wife goes to the grocery
store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make at least 1 good friend who is a neighbor.</strong> We just moved.  Our
neighbors seem like they might be cool.  Science says having friends makes
you live longer &ndash; especially if they live close by.  Also part of the appeal
of financial independence is having more time to spend with friends and family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write about how to get stuff done - project management for people
who aren&rsquo;t project managers.</strong> I think writing is the best way to learn.
Getting better at managing projects at home and at work has been on my mind for
the last 2 years.  Time is everyone&rsquo;s biggest constraint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get 100 readers per month on this blog by the end of the year.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn to walk on my hands.</strong>  Last year my fitness goal was 100 pushups
and 20 pullups every other day.  Shockingly I managed to acheive that.  I am
apparently old and delicate so it took me most of the year.  But it was just a
stepping stone to my larger goal of learning to walk on my hands.  How is this
useful?  Its not.  I want to be strong but I need a specific goal.  This one
sounded more fun than &ldquo;lift 500 pounds&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fix my knee injury.</strong>  I need to see a physical therapist so I can run
again.  I&rsquo;ve been putting this off and trying to solve it on my own for
years which is dumb.</p>
</li>
