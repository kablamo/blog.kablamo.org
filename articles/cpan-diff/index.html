                <p>At work we have a Pinto powered darkpan.  But developers install stuff from
cpan on their development servers to try things out and occasionally these
experiments don&rsquo;t get cleaned up and cause problems.  It would be nice nice to
know what modules are installed on a machine and how that compares to whats on
our darkpan.  Specifically I want to know which modules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older than those on the darkpan</li>
<li>Newer than those on the darkpan</li>
<li>Installed on the server but are not in the darkpan</li>
</ul>
<p>I solved this by stealing a lot of code from
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpan-outdated">cpan-outdated</a> and writing
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Diff">CPAN::Diff</a>:</p>
<pre><code># Usage
$ cpan-diff --help

# Find local modules which are older than whats available in the CPAN
