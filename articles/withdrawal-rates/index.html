<p>Lets say you reach your goal of retirement.  You quit your job sit on your
sailboat and eat pineapples all day.  The wind is in your hair, you are relaxed
and carefree, and you have pineapple breath.  All because you have a formidable
nest egg and can live comfortably off your investment earnings.</p>
<p>But how do you know how much of your nest egg you can withdraw and spend each
year?</p>
<h2 id="how-to-calculate-your-withdrawal-rate">How to calculate your withdrawal rate</h2>
<p><b>Step 1</b></p>
<p>Calculate how much you spend each year.  This step requires actual
effort so people often don&rsquo;t bother.  But this step is the <em>key</em> to retiring early
and the key to retiring at all.  Happily there are online tools to help you.  I
of course will recommend <a href="http://networthify.com">Networthify</a>.  But
<a href="http://cashbasehq.com">CashBaseHQ</a> and <a href="http://mint.com">Mint</a> are great
as well.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b></p>
<p>Divide your annual spending by the size of your nest egg.  Thats your
withdrawal rate.</p>
<p>
  \[ 
    \begin{aligned}
      NestEgg \times WithdrawalRate &amp; =  AnnualSpending \\
                     WithdrawalRate &amp; =  \frac{ AnnualSpending }{ NestEgg } \\
    \end{aligned}
  \]
</p>
<h2 id="but">But&hellip;</h2>
<p>But there is a problem.  Your withdrawal rate could change dramatically
each year depending on the size of your nest egg each year.  For example:</p>
<p><b>A happy scenario</b></p>
<p>Your $1 million nest egg earns 10% returns this year.  <br>
Your withdrawal rate could be as high as $100,000.</p>
<p><b>A sad scenario</b></p>
<p>Your $1 million nest egg earns 1% returns this year.  <br>
Your withdrawal rate could be as high as $10,000.</p>
<p>Those are radically different outcomes.  Living off $10,000 for a year will not
get you to the pineapple breath you were hoping for.  Now consider how big a
difference it makes if you have 15 good years when you first retire vs if you
happen to get 15 bad years.  It is massive.</p>
<p>If you are starting your career and trying to plan for retirement, all the
calculators out there ask you to input a withdrawal rate.  <b>What you now know
is that is impossible to know</b>.  It will depend on market conditions,
inflation, and changes to tax law.  And none of those is knowable.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>If you are already retired this means you need to be flexible when considering
your withdrawal rate.  Each year will be different and you must be especially
careful in your first 10 years of retirement.</p>
<p>But what do you do if you are starting your career and trying to plan your
retirement?  Basically we guess.  But we do an educated guess.</p>
<p>Researchers like Wade Pfau have discovered that a nest egg that uses a constant
withdrawal rate of 4% survives any period of US stock market history &ndash;
including the Great Depression.  This is why all of networthify&rsquo;s calculators
default to a 4% withdrawal rate.</p>
<p>That sounds like good news, but remember that past performance doesn&rsquo;t predict
future performance.  Most worrying Wade Pfau also ran the numbers using
European historical stock market data and found that in some countries there
were periods when a withdrawal rate of 0 would not preserve your nest egg.</p>
