                <p>I am learning about online credit card processing.
<a href="/2014/03/18/cc-processors/">Part 1</a> introduced a number of basic definitions.</p>
<p>The number of online payments is going to grow.  Only <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/credit-card-payments-growth_n_1575417.html">6% of credit card transactions are currently done online</a>.
With so much at stake, there are hundreds of payment gateways who provide a
variety of services. But I have chosen to divide them into two categories.</p>
<p>First there are <em>traditional gateways</em> who charge a monthly fee (in addition to
a variety of other fees) and often you need to obtain a merchant account on
your own which also has various fees associated with it.</p>
<p>The second category contains newer <em>full stack gateways</em> who are more user
friendly and provide a merchant account and a much simpler fee structure which
is generally a percentage charge on a per transaction basis with no monthly
fees.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; gateways are convenient and easy but they can cost more.
They generally charge 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.  Compare that to a
more traditional gateway such as <a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a> who
charges $20 per month and $0.10 per transaction.  However you also have to
factor in the cost of a merchant account.  And both the gateway and merchant&rsquo;s
bank often charge a variety of fees which makes it difficult to assess the true
cost.</p>
<p>If you are doing a large number of transactions, saving small amounts of money
is going to make a big difference.  If you are not then it may be cheaper to
use a full stack processor and save yourself the dev work and accounting
effort.</p>
<p>One interesting company I would like to note is
<a href="https://spreedly.com">Spreedly</a>.  Spreedly provides an api layer on top many
other payment gateways so you can swap out gateways whenever you feel like it.
Their service works with a large number of payment gateways &ndash; currently 60
gateways in 73 countries.  They also give you the ability to deposit funds in
different merchant accounts based on location or other business logic.  They do
have a monthly fee structure and clearly you would only choose this solution if
you are processing a large number of transactions.</p>

<p>Also I found this series of videos was an excellent introduction to
understanding payments at a lower level.  Be aware this is probably more than
most web developers need/want to know.</p>
