            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I have recently been playing with <a href="http://www.rexify.org/">Rex</a> and wanted to
write down some of my initial thoughts.</p>
<p>Rex is a devops tool that helps you manage your servers.  Its similar to
Puppet Lab&rsquo;s <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/mcollective">mcollective</a> tool or
<a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/">ansible</a>.  You can easily run commands on
your entire fleet of boxen or just on certain subgroups.  And you can run
them in parallel which saves you giant baskets of time.</p>
<p>The big advantage for People Who Prefer Perl (PWPP) is that Rex is written and
configured with Perl. So for the most part you don&rsquo;t need to spend a lot of time
learning yet another DSL.</p>
<p>Another happy positive is that you don&rsquo;t need to install any software on your
servers. Installation is simple:</p>
<pre><code>$ apt-get install libssh2-1-dev
$ cpanm Rex
</code></pre>
<p>Configuration is also simple &ndash; at least if you know Perl.  The
Rex configuration file is named &lsquo;Rexfile&rsquo; and its syntax is Perl with some
extra Rexy sugar methods thrown in. And I feel the sugar and general API for
Rex is fairly well done.  Here is an example Rexfile:</p>
<pre><code># Configure the default user and your ssh keys.  The default user can be
# overridden on the command line with the -u option.
user &quot;joe&quot;;
private_key &quot;/home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa&quot;;
public_key &quot;/home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&quot;;
key_auth;

# Cofigure server groups
group prod =&gt; &quot;webserver&quot;, &quot;mailserver&quot;, &quot;dbserver&quot;;
group dev  =&gt; &quot;pancake[1-3]&quot;, &quot;narwhale[1-3]&quot;, &quot;honeybadger[1-3]&quot;;

# Run commands in parallel on up to 100 servers at one time.  This can be
# overridden on the command line with the -t option.
parallelism 100;

# Create tasks.  This task runs against all servers by default.  This can
# be overridden on the command line with the -G or -H options.
task 'uptime', group =&gt; 'all', sub {
    my $output = run &quot;uptime&quot;;
    say $output;
};
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that Perl&rsquo;s &lsquo;say&rsquo; command is available by default.  &lsquo;run&rsquo; is a Rex
sugar method which accepts a shell command and returns the output &ndash; similar
to Capture::Tiny.</p>
<p>Here is a command line example which runs the &lsquo;uptime&rsquo; task as the &lsquo;root&rsquo; user
on each server in the &lsquo;dev&rsquo; group:</p>
<pre><code>$ rex -G dev -u root uptime
    pancake1:  16:42:05 up 221 days,  9:49,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale2:  16:42:05 up 8 days,  3:28,  4 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale3:  16:42:05 up 17 days,  3:57,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.01, 0.00
honeybadger1:  16:42:05 up 80 days,  3:29,  1 user,  load average: 0.09, 0.06, 0.01
    pancake3:  16:42:05 up 137 days,  7:49,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale1:  16:42:05 up 65 days,  5:30,  2 users,  load average: 0.46, 0.41, 0.37
honeybadger3:  16:42:04 up 15 days,  4:49,  1 user,  load average: 2.00, 2.00, 2.00
    pancake2:  16:42:04 up 1 day,  2:23,  3 users,  load average: 1.38, 1.35, 1.30
honeybadger2:  16:42:05 up 39 days,  1:24,  1 user,  load average: 0.08, 0.06, 0.01
</code></pre>
<p>Rex is fantastic for ad-hoc commands.  But it also has a great set of libraries
for doing much more like installing debian packages, user management,
virtualization, and managing EC2 boxes.  I have to say I&rsquo;m deeply attracted to
its simplicity &ndash; especially after dealing with Puppet&rsquo;s complicated and weird
DSL.</p>
<p>If anyone uses Rex to manage more than 50 servers, I would love to get in touch
with you and ask a few questions.</p>
