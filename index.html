Hey!  I'm @kablamo. I want to do more and be better.  I like new ideas.
Sometimes I drink the cool aid.  I write about dev and ops and getting stuff
done and whatever else I'm thinking about.  Below is every article I've ever
written.

      I want to do more, be better, and move the needle.  Whether I'm working
      on my personal, professional, or fitness goals, I want to be a great
      product manager and a great project manager.  Getting there requires
      goals, working on the most important thing, learning from mistakes, and
      collecting the best ideas.
