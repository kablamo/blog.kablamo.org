<h1>PSGI Applications</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/PSGI/PSGI.pod">PSGI spec</a> defines
a PSGI application.</p>

<blockquote><p>A PSGI application is a Perl code reference. It takes exactly one argument,
the environment, and returns an array reference containing exactly three
values [(a status, header, and body)].</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>my $app = sub {
    my $env = shift;
    return [
        '200',
        [ 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/plain' ],
        [ "Hello World" ], # or IO::Handle-like object
    ];
};
</code></pre>

<h1>The PSGI environment hash</h1>

<p>The PSGI environment hash is a hashref with many keys.  But mostly it is the
data (headers, body, etc) from a <a href="HTTP::Request">HTTP::Request</a> which have been parsed put into
a hash for convenient access.</p>

<h1>Middleware</h1>

<p>A middleware component takes a PSGI application and runs it, passing in the
PSGI environment hash.  But before it runs the app, it gets to modify the
environment if it wants to.  And after running the app, it can modify the
response if it wants to.</p>

<h1>Plack::Middleware</h1>

<p>Middleware is a wrapper around a PSGI app.  More than one middleware can be
wrapped around an app, creating a series of layers like an
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jakob/2012/09/28/middleware-onion.png/500px-MiddlewareOnion.svg.png">onion</a>.
What makes the middleware onion a somewhat unusual construct is the event
driven / callback nature of it.  Lets look at how its implemented.</p>

<p>All middleware inherits from Plack::Middleware which is an itsy bitsy (teeny
weeny) module.  The middleware onion is created with just 2 short subroutines
(notice the <code>call()</code> and <code>prepare_app()</code> subs are written by middleware authors):</p>

<pre><code>sub wrap {
    my($self, $app, @args) = @_;
    if (ref $self) {
        $self-&gt;{app} = $app;
    } else {
        $self = $self-&gt;new({ app =&gt; $app, @args });
    }
    return $self-&gt;to_app;
}

sub to_app {
    my $self = shift;
    $self-&gt;prepare_app;
    return sub { $self-&gt;call(@_) };
}
</code></pre>

<p>How do these subs work together?  The middleware onion is sometimes constructed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>my $app = MyWebApp-&gt;new-&gt;to_app;
$app = Plack::Middleware::A-&gt;wrap($app);
$app = Plack::Middleware::B-&gt;wrap($app);
$app = Plack::Middleware::C-&gt;wrap($app);
</code></pre>

<p>But it might be more clear to write it this way</p>

<pre><code>my $app0 = MyWebApp-&gt;new-&gt;to_app;           # $app0-&gt;($env) runs the web app
$app1 = Plack::Middleware::A-&gt;wrap($app0);  # $app1-&gt;($env) calls P::M::A-&gt;call() which calls $app0-&gt;($env)
$app2 = Plack::Middleware::B-&gt;wrap($app1);  # $app2-&gt;($env) calls P::M::B-&gt;call() which calls $app1-&gt;($env)
$app3 = Plack::Middleware::C-&gt;wrap($app2);  # $app3-&gt;($env) calls P::M::C-&gt;call() which calls $app2-&gt;($env)
                                            # When the server receives a request it calls $app3-&gt;($env)
</code></pre>

<p>So when an event occurs &mdash; for example the PSGI server sees a new request &mdash; it
passes the event to the app.  The app is a chain of callbacks which run each
other.  This is clearly an example of event driven programming.</p>

<h1>Plack::Component and Plack::App</h1>

<p>Plack::Middleware inherits from Plack::Component.  So the most common use of
Plack::Component is in middleware.</p>

<p>Plack::Component can also be used as a tool for creating PSGI applications.  It
has a light dusting of code, but mostly its an interface which is implemented
by modules in the Plack::App namespace.  For example Plack::App::File is a web
app which serves static files from a root directory, and Plack::App::URLMap is
a web app which maps multiple web apps to multiple urls.</p>

<p>But notice that I am not required to use Plack::Component to create a PSGI
application. A PSGI application is just a code reference.  The PSGI spec does
not say that a PSGI application is a reference to code that inherits from
Plack::Component.</p>

<p>The nice thing about using Plack::Component to build my app is that it
provides a common interface for all PSGI apps.  Whenever I see <code>$app</code>, I
can rely on that behavior.  This is clearly important for middleware.  And it
feels good from a design point of view.</p>

<p>But its not required and it adds some complexity.</p>

</ul>


<h1>Plack::Runner and plackup</h1>

<p><code>plackup</code> starts a PSGI server which executes a PSGI application.  However
the script itself is just a very small wrapper around Plack::Runner which does
all the heavy lifting.  Plack::Runner</p>

<ol>
<li> parses the command line options.</li>
<li> instantiates the chosen loader class (which is in the Plack::Loader namespace).</li>
<li> instatiates the chosen server library (which is in the Plack::Handler namespace).</li>
<li> starts the PSGI server and passes it a PSGI application</li>
</ol>


<h1>Plack::Loader</h1>

<p>Loaders are responsible for instantiating and running the PSGI server.  Here are
the more interesting capabilities a <code>$loader</code> object has:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$loader-&gt;guess()</code> guesses which server library should be loaded by looking at command line opts, $ENV, and %INC.</li>
<li><code>$loader-&gt;load()</code> instantiates the server library and returns the object.</li>
<li><code>$loader-&gt;run()</code> starts the server.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Plack::Loader namespace contains 3 kinds of loaders:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plack::Loader::Delayed &ndash; delays compilation of the web app until the first request occurs</li>
<li>Plack::Loader::Restarter &ndash; reloads the server if any files are changed</li>
<li>Plack::Loader::Shotgun &ndash; foreach request, forks a child which compiles the web app and runs it</li>
</ul>


<p>I can choose which loader I want using <code>plack --loader</code></p>

<h1>Plack::Handler</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/PSGI/PSGI.pod">PSGI spec</a>
tells me that PSGI defines the interface between an application and a server.
Because the PSGI spec is (intentionally) very minimal, there is a good deal of
wiggle room to interpret how an application and a server might want to play
together.</p>

<p>A library in the Plack::Handler namespace is the place where the application
meets the server.  This layer contains all the wiggling.</p>

<p>Lets say I wrote a new server called AngryBrontosaurus and I want to be able to
use it with <code>plackup --server AngryBrontosaurus</code>.  I could implement a small
class like this:</p>

<pre><code>package Plack::Handler::AngryBrontosaurus
use strict;
use AngryBrontosaurus;

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    bless { @_ }, $class;
}

sub run {
    my ($self, $app) = @_; 
    AngryBrontosaurus-&gt;new-&gt;run($app, $self);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to make sure AngryBrontosaurus and Plack::Handler::AngryBrontosaurus
correctly implement the PSGI spec, I should also test my code with
Plack::Test::Suite.</p>

<pre><code>use Test::More;
use Plack::Test::Suite;
Plack::Test::Suite-&gt;run_server_tests('AngryBrontosaurus');
done_testing;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that while the Plack::Handler namespace contains classes for several
PSGI servers like Plack::Handler::Starman or Plack::Handler::Twiggy, it also
includes some classes like Plack::Handler::Apache2 and Plack::Handler::FCGI.
Clearly Apache2 was not written with PSGI compliance in mind, but there is glue
in the Plack::Handler::Apache2 layer to enable it to speak with PSGI compliant
applications.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I write lots of code.  But I want to be better and faster at reading code.
When I had the privilege of working with @ranguard I discovered he is a code
reading <em>cheetah</em> and I always envied that.  So I&rsquo;ve decided to practice
by reading the source code of various CPAN modules.  I&rsquo;m starting with Plack.</p>

<li><a href="/2014/04/12/read-plack-4">Part 4 &ndash; Plack::Builder</a></li>
</ul>


<h1>Plack</h1>

<p>Plack describes itself as a set of tools for using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/PSGI">PSGI</a> (the Perl Server Gateway Interface).</p>

<p>The earliest release of Plack on CPAN is version 0.9000 from 2009-10-13.  There
were releases several times a week for the first <strong>two years</strong>.  Impressively, in
2012 releases were still happening roughly once a week.  In 2013 things seem to
have cooled and now releases happen about once a month.</p>

<p>The code itself is written tersely and with attention to detail.  There are
almost no comments.  In fact 43 out of 71 files have fewer than 3 comments.
Of course the code is very well written which makes comments less necessary and
nowadays there is quite a bit of excellent POD as well.</p>

<p>The code also makes heavy use of callbacks (code references).  That is to say
its heavily event driven. Which makes sense given the event driven nature of web
servers.  For me this gave the code a JavaScript flavor.  Take for example
<code>Plack::Util::foreach</code> which works just like
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/">jQuery.each()</a> by iterating over an array
calling a code reference on each item.</p>

<pre><code>Plack::Util::foreach([1,2,3], sub { print shift }); # prints "123"
</code></pre>

<h2>Background reading</h2>

<p>The most important thing to read is the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/PSGI/PSGI.pod">PSGI spec</a>.
This is the problem Plack was built to solve.  Its clear and well
written but perhaps also a little boring and lacking in context. Still I found
it very helpful to refer back to while reading the code.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<pre><code>~/code ⚡ git clone git@github.com:plack/Plack.git
~/code ⚡ cd Plack
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing I noticed is a <code>cpanfile</code> containing a list of the project
dependencies.  Because understanding and running the tests is often useful
when reading new code I installed the dependencies using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton">Carton</a> and ran the tests.</p>

<pre><code>~/code/Plack ⚡ carton
~/code/Plack ⚡ prove -rl t
</code></pre>

<h2>Who works on Plack?</h2>

<p>Lets get a feel for who is involved in the project.</p>

<h2>What is the lib directory structure like?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately with 71 files in the lib directory its hard to grok whats
happening in a single glance so maybe thats not a great question.  Instead I
found it helpful to group the code by functionality.  I came up
with 3 major categories which look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Category 1</em> &ndash; Modules for loading and running PSGI servers

<ul>
<li>plackup</li>
<li>Plack::Handler</li>
<li>Plack::Handler::*</li>
<li>Plack::Loader</li>
<li>Plack::Loader::*</li>
<li>Plack::Runner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Category 2</em> &ndash; Modules for building PSGI apps

<ul>
<li>Plack::App::*</li>
<li>Plack::Builder</li>
<li>Plack::Component</li>
<li>Plack::Middleware</li>
<li>Plack::Middleware::*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Category 3</em> &ndash; Modules for testing

<ul>
<li>Plack::Test</li>
<li>Plack::Test::*</li>
<li>Plack::<a href="HTTP::Message::PSGI">HTTP::Message::PSGI</a></li>
<li>Plack::LWPish</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>However I also got crazy and went ahead and listed <em>everything</em> in the lib
directory along with a brief description.  I guess it might be handy for
reference purposes.  The numbers (1), (2), (3) below correspond to the three
categories I listed above.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When Perl&rsquo;s regex engine evaluates a string, it moves from left to right, one
letter at a time checking the match at each position.  That position is called
the <em>current match position</em>.</p>

<p>Look around assertions allow you to match a specific pattern before or after
the current match position without moving the match position.</p>

<h1>Look ahead assertions</h1>

<p>Look ahead assertions match the text after the current match position
(without moving the match position).  They look like <code>(?=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>my $job = "space cowboy";
$job =~ /space (?=cow)/;    # matches
$job =~ /space (?=cow)cow/; # also matches
</code></pre>

<h1>Look behind assertions</h1>

<p>Look behind assertions match the text before the current match position
(without moving the match position).  They look like <code>(?&lt;=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>my $job = "space cowboy";
$job =~ /(?&lt;=space) cowboy/;      # matches
$job =~ /space(?&lt;=space) cowboy/; # also matches
</code></pre>

<h1>Positive and negative look ahead assertions</h1>

<p><em>Positive</em> look ahead assertions are look ahead assertions which match when their
subpattern matches. They look like <code>(?=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /space (?=cowboy)/;   # matches
</code></pre>

<p><em>Negative</em> look ahead assertions are look ahead assertions which match when their
subpattern fails. They look like <code>(?!pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /space (?!mooseboy)/;   # matches
</code></pre>

<h1>Positive and negative look behind assertions</h1>

<p>Positive look behind assertions are look behind assertions which match when their
subpattern matches. They look like <code>(?&lt;=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /(?&lt;=space) cowboy/;   # matches
</code></pre>

<p>Negative look behind assertions are look behind assertions which match when
their subpattern fails. They look like <code>(?&lt;!pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /(?&lt;!earth) cowboy/;   # matches
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><ul>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to buy.</strong>  Especially when I end up only using things
once or twice like books, dvds, dress shoes, and ties.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to store.</strong>  One time I had to rent a storage locker
because I couldn&rsquo;t take my things when I moved to China.  Some people get
big houses with walk in closets and a three car garage.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to maintain.</strong>  Broken stuff needs to be fixed.  Owning
a house means I need to fix the roof. Owning a car means I need to change
the tires.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is time consuming to maintain.</strong>  I have to dust my stuff.
A bigger house means more sweeping.
A bigger yard means more mowing. Owning a car means cleaning it and
changing the oil and scraping ice off the windows.<br/>
I need to go to the store to find replacement parts,
batteries, light bulbs, cleaning supplies, and duct tape.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is stressful to own.</strong>  I might
lose it or dent it or scratch it or drop it or step on it.  Or it might
catch on fire.  Or someone might steal it.  Sometimes I get so stressed I buy
insurance for my stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff reduces my freedom.</strong>  Its hard to move to new place because I have
to carry all my stuff with me.</li>
</ul>


<p>Therefore I have decided to live with less stuff.  So I hereby declare war on
my stuff.  And also on my things.  Here is my 4 point plan to free myself from
the tedious tyranny of too many things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Point 1:</strong> Keep a comprehensive inventory of all my stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Point 2:</strong> Ruthlessly reduce the number of things in my inventory to less than 200.</li>
<li><strong>Point 3:</strong> No new stuff unless I throw out some old stuff first.</li>
<li><strong>Point 4:</strong> Have a beer.</li>
</ul>


<p>If I were hard core I would throw out everything I didn&rsquo;t use in the last 6
months.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll be hard core at some point in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am learning about online credit card processing.
<a href="/2014/03/18/cc-processors/">Part 1</a> introduced a number of basic definitions.</p>

<p>The number of online payments is going to grow.  Only <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/credit-card-payments-growth_n_1575417.html">6% of credit card transactions are currently done online</a>.
With so much at stake, there are hundreds of payment gateways who provide a
variety of services. But I have chosen to divide them into two categories.</p>

<p>First there are <em>traditional gateways</em> who charge a monthly fee (in addition to
a variety of other fees) and often you need to obtain a merchant account on
your own which also has various fees associated with it.</p>

<p>The second category contains newer <em>full stack gateways</em> who are more user
friendly and provide a merchant account and a much simpler fee structure which
is generally a percentage charge on a per transaction basis with no monthly
fees.</p>

<p>These &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; gateways are convenient and easy but they can cost more.
They generally charge 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.  Compare that to a
more traditional gateway such as <a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a> who
charges $20 per month and $0.10 per transaction.  However you also have to
factor in the cost of a merchant account.  And both the gateway and merchant&rsquo;s
bank often charge a variety of fees which makes it difficult to assess the true
cost.</p>

<p>If you are doing a large number of transactions, saving small amounts of money
is going to make a big difference.  If you are not then it may be cheaper to
use a full stack processor and save yourself the dev work and accounting
effort.</p>

<p>One interesting company I would like to note is
<a href="https://spreedly.com">Spreedly</a>.  Spreedly provides an api layer on top many
other payment gateways so you can swap out gateways whenever you feel like it.
Their service works with a large number of payment gateways &mdash; currently 60
gateways in 73 countries.  They also give you the ability to deposit funds in
different merchant accounts based on location or other business logic.  They do
have a monthly fee structure and clearly you would only choose this solution if
you are processing a large number of transactions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always <code>use strict</code> in all my code.  But what does that actually mean?</p>

<h1>Enables strict refs</h1>

<p>Strict refs generates runtime errors when you use symbolic references.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'refs';
$ref = "yarrr matey";
print $$ref;        # runtime error but without strict refs this is ok
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict vars</h1>

<p>Strict vars generates a compile time error if you access a variable that was
not declared or is not fully qualified.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'vars';
$X::foo = 1;         # ok because its fully qualified
my $foo = 10;        # ok because my() was used.
$baz = 9;            # compile time error because $baz not declared before
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict subs</h1>

<p>Strict subs generates a compile time error if you use a bareword identifier
that&rsquo;s not a subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>no strict 'subs';
my $a = boop;
print $a; 
sub boop { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;boop&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf;      # &lt;--- compile time error here
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above generates a compile time error on line 2.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf(); 
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo; which is probably the desired output.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to understand credit card processing.  So I will probably write a few
articles about it.  This article has some fundamental definitions.</p>

<h2>acquiring bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquiring_bank">acquiring bank</a> is a bank
which processes card payments on behalf of a merchant.  The term &lsquo;acquirer&rsquo;
indicates the bank accepts (or acquires) credit card payments from card
issuing banks within a credit card association.  Acquirers take all the risk
and bear the burdern of most of the regulation.  Examples of acquirers are
Bank of America, FirstData, and Chase.</p>

<h2>credit card association</h2>

<p>Examples of credit card associations include Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
American Express, etc.</p>

<h2>issuing bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issuing_bank">issuing bank</a> is a bank which
provides credit cards to consumers.  The term &lsquo;issue&rsquo; indicates the bank issues
payments to the acquiring bank on behalf of the consumer.  The top issuers in
the US are American Express and Chase.</p>

<h2>payment processor</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://storecoach.com/blog/whats-difference-between-payment-processor-gateway/">payment processor</a>
is a company which peforms the actual funds transfer.  Its the technical
underpinning of a transaction.  Processors do authorization, funds transfer,
statements, calculate the interchange fee, and handle dispute management.
Processors take no risk on a transaction.  Examples of companies who are
processors are FirstData, Chase, and RBS WorldPay.</p>

<h2>gateway</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway">payment gateway</a> is a service
which ties all the various groups together and provides a nice simple interface for
the merchant to build a shopping cart or marketplace without needing to
understand all the gory details.  The gateway authorizes credit card payments
by facillitating the transfer of information between a merchant&rsquo;s bank (the
acquiring bank) and a customer&rsquo;s bank (the issuing bank).</p>

<h2>merchant account</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account">merchant account</a> is a type
of bank account provided by an acquiring bank which allows merchants to accept
payments via credit card.</p>

<h2>interchange fee</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_fee">interchange fee</a> is
the fee paid to the issuing bank by the acquiring bank.  The amount varies by
card type, card brand, transaction amount, and other factors and is set by the
card associations like Visa, Mastercard, or Discover.</p>

<h2>discount rate</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://merchantwarehouse.com/understanding-merchant-account-discount-rates">discount rate</a>
is made up of several different fees which are charged to the merchant.  This
usually includes the interchange fee.  The discount rate is a fixed
percentage-based fee charged for each transaction.  A portion of the fee is
passed to the acquiring bank who likely passes a portion to the issuing bank
who in turn passes a portion to the credit card association.</p>

<p>Rates are influenced by many things including the level of risk. Brick and
mortar stores where a card is physically present are considered the lowest
risk.  There are three categories of transaction types based on risk and each
have a different discount rate: qualified, mid-qualified and non-qualified.
Internet transactions are non-qualified which is the most expensive category.</p>

<h2>basis point</h2>

<p>1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account#Terms_to_know">basis point</a>
is 1%.  A term sometimes used when discussing the discount rate.</p>

<h2>Average Ticket Size (AVT)</h2>

<p>The might make more sense to outsiders if they had called it Average
Transaction Size.  Its the total monthly sales amount divided by the total
number of transactions for that month.  Merchant account rates and fees are
often based on a merchant&rsquo;s monthly AVT.</p>

<h2>PCI DSS</h2>

<p>PCI stands for Payment Card Industry.  DSS stands for Data Security Standard.
It is a set of security standards for organizations who handle cardholder
information.  It is defined by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)
which was formed in 2006 by the major card associations.  Note that there is a
difference between being compliant being validated as compliant.  Validation is
done annually by a Qualified Security Accessor (QSA) who creates a Report on
Compliance (ROC) for organizations handle lots of transactions or a
Self-Assessment Questionaire (SAQ) for companies handling less transactions.</p>
