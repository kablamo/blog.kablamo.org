# Life is poker, not chess

To win at chess: be perfect.  In chess, there is always a right answer and a
wrong answer.  I can compute a perfect game if I'm smart enough and I do enough
calculations.  

In poker, where randomness is built into the game, its not about being perfect.
Its about being consistent.  

Poker players don't win in a single hand.  They don't win by risking it all on
a single big bet.  They consistently make lots of small every day decisions
correctly again and again.  They don't need to be perfect.  Even if they play
every hand "perfectly" they will still lose at times.  

Doing the small things right is hard and requires analysis, self awareness,
emotional control, practice, and experience.  Its rare that a newcomer with no
experience starts playing poker and immediately wins big.  And even if they do,
they soon lose it all.
