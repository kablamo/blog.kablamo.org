I originally gave this talk at Chicago.pm as part of a “Distribution Management
Shootout” – a 3 way duel between:

 - jberger's [talk](http://jberger.github.io/ModuleBuildPresentation) about Module::Build and and the "Classic" build systems
 - preaction's [talk](http://preaction.github.io/Introduction-to-Dist-Zilla) about Dist::Zilla, and 
 - my [talk](http://kablamo.org/slides-first-cpan-module) about Minilla and Carton.

It was a great overview of the most popular tools and I think all the talks
are worth checking out.

As usual, this talk is both a living document and reference material. I keep my
talks updated and relevant so I can refer people to them. If I’ve missed
anything feel free to contribute to the github repo or leave a comment.
