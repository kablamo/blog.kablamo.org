1. **Spend less than $36,500 in 2017.** If I can keep my spending at this level
   I should be on my way to a long term goal of being financially
independent at age 42.  We spent about $45,000 in 2016.

2. **Build a portfolio of airline miles and hotel points by travel hacking
   credit cards.** This could save me $4,000 a year or more in annual plane
tickets and hotels for a family of 3 to travel to Singapore.  We go every year
to visit my wife's family.  I completed a free 15 day email course at
[travelmiles101.com](https://travelmiles101.com) and I can't recommend that
enough.

3. **Help my wife get her license.** Time is the most valuable thing.  It would
   be way more efficient if I can do chores while my wife goes to the grocery
store.

4. **Make at least 1 good friend who is a neighbor.** We just moved.  Our
   neighbors seem like they might be cool.  Science says having friends makes
you live longer -- especially if they live close by.  Also part of the appeal
of financial independence is having more time to spend with friends and family.  

5. **Write about how to get stuff done - project management for people
   who aren't project managers.** I think writing is the best way to learn.
Getting better at managing projects at home and at work has been on my mind for
the last 2 years.  Time is everyone's biggest constraint.  

6. **Get 100 readers per month on this blog by the end of the year.** 

7. **Learn to walk on my hands.**  Last year my fitness goal was 100 pushups
   and 20 pullups every other day.  Shockingly I managed to acheive that.  I am
apparently old and delicate so it took me most of the year.  But it was just a
stepping stone to my larger goal of learning to walk on my hands.  How is this
useful?  Its not.  I want to be strong but I need a specific goal.  This one
sounded more fun than "lift 500 pounds".

8. **Fix my knee injury.**  I need to see a physical therapist so I can run
   again.  I've been putting this off and trying to solve it on my own for
years which is dumb.
