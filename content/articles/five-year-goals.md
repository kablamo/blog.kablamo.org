Maybe writing about my long term goals occasionally will help me think through
them and commit to them. 

I currently group my goals into 4 major categories. I try to re-evaluate them
frequently.  Which means they change.  I try to look at them every day so they
are top of mind and I don't get off track.  

To achieve these goals I need to break them down into smaller and smaller
chunks until I find a chunk thats easy to do.  Basically its just a matter of
solving problems until all the problems are gone and I reach my goal.
Prioritization, measuring progress, and not getting stuck are important too.


# Financial independence

I want to be financially independent by 2020.  Which means I need to save
enough money that I can live off the investment returns.

Some clarification: Its not my goal to sit around and do nothing.   And I'm
not necessarily going to quit my job.  My job is amazing, my coworkers are
brilliant, I'm learning a lot, and our product is both cool and useful.  

The purpose is to have the freedom to do what I want.  And to know with
certainty I'm doing what I want.  And to be able to protect my family from risk
and change more easily.

There are 3 ways to generate wealth. I will need to:

1. Keep expenses low
2. Keep income high
3. Invest wisely


# Good health

Life is good.  I want to live forever. Failing that I'd like to live as long as
possible with a high quality of life.

Basic goals

  - Eat well
  - Sleep a lot
  - Healthy teeth
  - Weight under 155
  - Aerobic:  Run 3 miles every day
  - Strength: 100 pushups every day
  - Strength:  20 pullups every day

Stretch goals

  - Strength: handstand
  - Body fat: 6 pack
  - Endurance: marathon

The fitness goals seem fairly simple to achieve but require quite a bit of
time.  The hard part for me is avoiding injury.  Diet is a harder problem.  I
eat pretty well.  Doing better here might require asking some experts and/or
just doing more research.


# Better relationships

I want:

 - Friends who live in my neighborhood
 - To see everyone in my family at least once a year
 - To visit friends who are spread around the world once a year

I'm an introvert, I work too much, and I have a 1 year old.  So I
suck at relationships.  Tribes are helpful and fun.  One of the big advantages
to financial independence is having the money and time to spend with friends
and family.

I believe that like anything else I can do better through analysis, planning,
and practice.  I have some ideas, but exactly what I'm going to do needs to be
fleshed out more.


# Awesome kids

I'd have tons of kids if I had tons of money and time.  Atm having more kids
sounds like a terrifying amount of work.  But I also think its one of the most
rewarding things a person can do and I especially think its going to be totally
worth it when I'm old.  This objective is woefully non specific atm and needs a
lot of work.
