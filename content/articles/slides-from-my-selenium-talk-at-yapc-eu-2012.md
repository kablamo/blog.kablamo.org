I gave my first [YAPC::EU](http://act.yapc.eu/ye2012/schedule?day=2012-08-20)
presentation this year in Frankfurt after doing a trial run at London.pm.  I
received some good questions and comments and a few new ideas.  It was a good
experience and I want to do this again.

My talk introduced Selenium and common problems people have when first trying
to write Selenium tests in Perl.  I also explained how I solved many of those
problems by creating
[Test::WWW::Selenium::More](https://metacpan.org/module/Test::WWW::Selenium::More).

The slides are available
[online](http://kablamo.org/selenium-2012-yapceu-slides/). Or if you need to
download them for some reason, they are hosted on
[github](https://github.com/kablamo/selenium-2012-yapceu-slides).
