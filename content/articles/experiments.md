 - **Stuff is expensive to buy.**  Especially when I end up only using things
   once or twice like books, dvds, dress shoes, and ties.
 - **Stuff is expensive to store.**  One time I had to rent a storage locker
   because I couldn't take my things when I moved to China.  Some people get
   big houses with walk in closets and a three car garage. 
 - **Stuff is expensive to maintain.**  Broken stuff needs to be fixed.  Owning
   a house means I need to fix the roof. Owning a car means I need to change
   the tires.
 - **Stuff is time consuming to maintain.**  I have to dust my stuff.
   A bigger house means more sweeping.
   A bigger yard means more mowing. Owning a car means cleaning it and
   changing the oil and scraping ice off the windows.  
   I need to go to the store to find replacement parts,
   batteries, light bulbs, cleaning supplies, and duct tape.
 - **Stuff is stressful to own.**  I might
   lose it or dent it or scratch it or drop it or step on it.  Or it might
   catch on fire.  Or someone might steal it.  Sometimes I get so stressed I buy
   insurance for my stuff.
 - **Stuff reduces my freedom.**  Its hard to move to new place because I have
   to carry all my stuff with me.

Therefore I have decided to live with less stuff.  So I hereby declare war on
my stuff.  And also on my things.  Here is my 4 point plan to free myself from
the tedious tyranny of too many things:

 - **Point 1:** Keep a comprehensive inventory of all my stuff.
 - **Point 2:** Ruthlessly reduce the number of things in my inventory to less than 200.
 - **Point 3:** No new stuff unless I throw out some old stuff first.
 - **Point 4:** Have a beer.

If I were hard core I would throw out everything I didn't use in the last 6
months.  Maybe I'll be hard core at some point in the future.
