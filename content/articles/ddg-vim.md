I created a Vim cheat sheet instant answer for DuckDuckDuckGo.  If you search
for [vim cheat sheet](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vim+cheat+sheet) or
[vim help](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vim+help) you will get a result like this:

The data is from rtorruellas's excellent [vim cheat sheet](http://rtorruellas.com/vim-cheat-sheet/) 
(also available on [github](https://github.com/rtorr/vim-cheat-sheet)) which has a responsive
mobile friendly layout and is also available in Japanese.
