I gave this talk last Thursday at
[Chicago.pm](http://chicago.pm.org/blog/2015/09/19/the-perl-test-ecosystem/).
This talk assumes the listener knows very little about testing in Perl but
likely has something for more advanced users as well.  

It begins with `prove` and `Test::More`, but then moves on to explore the `Test::`
namespace on CPAN and talk about 20 other test modules.  CPAN has a large
number of modules to help with testing -- its a pretty healthy ecosystem.  

My goal was to create talk which not only gives new people an introduction to
testing in Perl, but also provides up to date advice about which modules are
useful and recommended.  Feedback and corrections welcome.

As usual, this talk is both a living document and reference material. I keep my
talks updated and relevant so I can refer people to them. If Iâ€™ve missed
anything feel free to contribute to the github repo or leave a comment.
