# 

I get excited and hop up and down when I read books that make me better or show
me new ideas.  This is a short list of the best, most useful, non fiction books
I've discovered.  (Follow me on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46583588-eric-johnson)?)

# How to Lead
[Turn The Ship Around][L1] by L. David Marquet<br>
*Key insight: Everyone in an organization should lead.  Leader-leader not leader-follower.*

This is the true story of how a naval officer took the most troubled
submarine in the fleet and gradually turned it into the best. This book teaches
you how to turn everyone under your command into a leader. 

[The Effective Engineer][L2] by Edmond Lau<br>
*Key insight: Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Spent*

This book teaches engineers and developers how to have the most impact.  As an
engineer at Google, Edmond Lau, took a year off work to interview leaders at
today's top tech companies in order to understand how to become a better
leader.  This book is the result and its a long book overflowing with
actionable advice and great real world stories to illustrate those concepts.
See the story of how instagram's team of 5 engineers built a service with 40
million followers.

[Leadership, Strategy, and Tactics][L3] by Jocko Willink<br>
This book is written by the leader of SEAL Team Three which operated in Iraq
and now advises businesses.  The author breaks down common problems he
encountered on the battlefield and describes how to solve them using leadership,
team work, and communication. And he shows how they apply in the business
world.  This book is about people and how they interact.

[Good To Great][L4] by Jim Collins<br>
The author lead a study that compared good companies with great ones.  His
findings are that the difference is determined by "level 5" leadership, a
culture of discipline, and the flywheel effect (famously adopted by Bezos and
Amazon). This book is a business classic and this author has written many.
