# Publish your first CPAN module in &lt; 5 minutes
I originally gave this talk at Chicago.pm as part of a "Distribution Management
Shootout" -- a 3 way duel between 

 - jberger's [talk](http://jberger.github.io/ModuleBuildPresentation) about Module::Build and the "Classic" build systems
 - preaction's [talk](http://preaction.github.io/Introduction-to-Dist-Zilla) about Dist::Zilla, and 
 - my [talk](http://kablamo.org/slides-first-cpan-module) about Minilla and Carton.

It was a great overview of the most popular tools and I thought all the talks
were worth checking out.
