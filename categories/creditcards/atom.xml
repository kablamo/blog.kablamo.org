    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to understand credit card processing.  So I will probably write a few
articles about it.  This article has some fundamental definitions.</p>

<h2>gateway</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway">payment gateway</a> is a service
which authorizes credit card payments by facillitating the transfer of
information between a merchant&rsquo;s bank (the acquiring bank) and a customer&rsquo;s
bank (the issuing bank).</p>

<h2>acquiring bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquiring_bank">acquiring bank</a> is a bank
which processes card payments on behalf of a merchant.  The term &lsquo;acquirer&rsquo;
indicates the bank accepts (or acquires) credit card payments from card
issuing banks within a credit card association.</p>

<h2>credit card association</h2>

<p>Examples of credit card associations include Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
American Express, etc.</p>

<h2>issuing bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issuing_bank">issuing bank</a> is a bank which
provides credit cards to consumers.  The term &lsquo;issue&rsquo; indicates the bank issues
payments to the acquiring bank on behalf of the consumer.</p>

<h2>merchant account</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account">merchant account</a> is a type
of bank account provided by an acquiring bank which allows merchants to accept
payments via credit card.</p>

<h2>interchange fee</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_fee">interchange fee</a> is
the fee paid the the issuing bank by the acquiring bank.  The amount varies by
card type, card brand, transaction amount, and other factors and is set by the
card associations like Visa, Mastercard, or Discover.</p>

<h2>discount rate</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account#Discount_Rates">discount rate</a>
is made up of several different fees which are charged to the merchant.  This
sometimes includes the interchange fee.</p>

<h2>basis point</h2>

<p>1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account#Terms_to_know">basis point</a>
is 1%.  A term sometimes used when discussing the discount rate.</p>

<h2>Average Ticket Size (AVT)</h2>

<p>The might make more sense to outsiders if they had called it Average
Transaction Size.  Its the total monthly sales amount divided by the total
number of transactions for that month.  Merchant account rates and fees are
often based on a merchant&rsquo;s monthly AVT.</p>

<h2>PCI DSS</h2>

<p>PCI stands for Payment Card Industry.  DSS stands for Data Security Standard.
It is a set of security standards for organizations who handle cardholder
information.  It is defined by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)
which was formed in 2006 by the major card associations.  Note that there is a
difference between being compliant being validated as compliant.  Validation is
done annually by a Qualified Security Accessor (QSA) who creates a Report on
Compliance (ROC) for organizations handle lots of transactions or a
Self-Assessment Questionaire (SAQ) for companies handling less transactions.</p>
