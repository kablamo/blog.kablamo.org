    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;m writing about something I noticed while doing interviews recently.</p>

<p>If I disagree with a decision a company made, I need to jump into that with
both feet.  There is sometimes an instinct to say &ldquo;I suppose I can live with
that&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know enough about why this choice was made to complain about
it&rdquo;.  But the goal is not to complain or to highlight their ignorance or to
have an argument.</p>

<p>Disagreeing starts a discussion.  This creates an opportunity to do 2 things.</p>

<p>First, it allows me to show case what I know.  The fact I have an opinion shows
I have worked on this problem before and over the course of the discussion I
will be able to demonstrate I understand the pros and cons of the different
options and have expertise there.</p>

<p>Second, I will come to understand why the company got into the position they
are in.  Usually there is a good reason.  If it was made through ignorance I
will find out if are they open to fixing the problem &mdash; subject to priorities
of course.  I may also learn if they are interested in my opinion or are
looking for a soldier who follows orders.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently relocated from London to the Chicago area so I have been doing
interviews.  When I interview a potential client or employer I carry this list of
questions with me.  Most of the questions I have taken from other sources
online.  I have listed them in roughly the order I ask them.</p>

<h1>Understanding the job</h1>

<ul>
<li>What will I be doing every day (precisely)?</li>
<li>Why are you hiring? New product? Scaling? Someone quit?</li>
<li>Who will I report to?</li>
<li>Who will I be working with?  How big are the teams?</li>
<li>What are my boss' goals for the next 6 months/year?</li>
<li>What is the key metric for the company? For my group? For my boss?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Understanding the culture</h1>

<ul>
<li>How do you build software?  Where do requirements and features come from?
Is it a very formal process or is there no process?</li>
<li>What problems does the group have that need to be solved?</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to fix legacy code and problems that exist?</li>
<li>What do you wish you had known before starting work here?</li>
<li>Whats the worst part of this job and whats the coolest thing you have built here, personally?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Tools and best practices</h1>

<ul>
<li>What tools are being used?

<ul>
<li>bug tracking</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>which version of Perl</li>
<li>what operating system</li>
<li>why were those choices made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to use the latest stuff from CPAN?</li>
<li>Are there tests?</li>
<li>Are there automated tests?</li>
<li>What is deployment like?</li>
<li>Is Moose used? OO?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is there any allowance for remote work?</li>

<li>Will I be oncall?</li>
</ul>
