more developer friendly and listing some key facts about each one.  All of
these provide a merchant account, gateway, payment processor etc and handle all
that complexity for you.</p>

    <updated>2014-03-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/21/cc-processors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am learning about online credit card processing.
<a href="/2014/03/18/cc-processors/">Part 1</a> introduced a number of basic definitions.</p>

<p>The number of online payments is going to grow.  Only <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/credit-card-payments-growth_n_1575417.html">6% of credit card transactions are currently done online</a>.
With so much at stake, there are hundreds of payment gateways who provide a
variety of services. But I have chosen to divide them into two categories.</p>

<p>First there are <em>traditional gateways</em> who charge a monthly fee (in addition to
a variety of other fees) and often you need to obtain a merchant account on
your own which also has various fees associated with it.</p>

<p>The second category contains newer <em>full stack gateways</em> who are more user
friendly and provide a merchant account and a much simpler fee structure which
is generally a percentage charge on a per transaction basis with no monthly
fees.</p>

<p>These &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; gateways are convenient and easy but they can cost more.
They generally charge 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.  Compare that to a
more traditional gateway such as <a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a> who
charges $20 per month and $0.10 per transaction.  However you also have to
factor in the cost of a merchant account.  And both the gateway and merchant&rsquo;s
bank often charge a variety of fees which makes it difficult to assess the true
cost.</p>

<p>If you are doing a large number of transactions, saving small amounts of money
is going to make a big difference.  If you are not then it may be cheaper to
use a full stack processor and save yourself the dev work and accounting
effort.</p>

<p>One interesting company I would like to note is
<a href="https://spreedly.com">Spreedly</a>.  Spreedly provides an api layer on top many
other payment gateways so you can swap out gateways whenever you feel like it.
Their service works with a large number of payment gateways &mdash; currently 60
gateways in 73 countries.  They also give you the ability to deposit funds in
different merchant accounts based on location or other business logic.  They do
have a monthly fee structure and clearly you would only choose this solution if
you are processing a large number of transactions.</p>

<p>Also I found this series of videos was an excellent introduction to
understanding payments at a lower level.  Be aware this is probably more than
most web developers need/want to know.</p>

    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/18/cc-processors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to understand credit card processing.  So I will probably write a few
articles about it.  This article has some fundamental definitions.</p>

<h2>acquiring bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquiring_bank">acquiring bank</a> is a bank
which processes card payments on behalf of a merchant.  The term &lsquo;acquirer&rsquo;
indicates the bank accepts (or acquires) credit card payments from card
issuing banks within a credit card association.  Acquirers take all the risk
and bear the burdern of most of the regulation.  Examples of acquirers are
Bank of America, FirstData, and Chase.</p>

<h2>credit card association</h2>

<p>Examples of credit card associations include Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
American Express, etc.</p>

<h2>issuing bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issuing_bank">issuing bank</a> is a bank which
provides credit cards to consumers.  The term &lsquo;issue&rsquo; indicates the bank issues
payments to the acquiring bank on behalf of the consumer.  The top issuers in
the US are American Express and Chase.</p>

<h2>payment processor</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://storecoach.com/blog/whats-difference-between-payment-processor-gateway/">payment processor</a>
is a company which peforms the actual funds transfer.  Its the technical
underpinning of a transaction.  Processors do authorization, funds transfer,
statements, calculate the interchange fee, and handle dispute management.
Processors take no risk on a transaction.  Examples of companies who are
processors are FirstData, Chase, and RBS WorldPay.</p>

<h2>gateway</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway">payment gateway</a> is a service
which ties all the various groups together and provides a nice simple interface for
the merchant to build a shopping cart or marketplace without needing to
understand all the gory details.  The gateway authorizes credit card payments
by facillitating the transfer of information between a merchant&rsquo;s bank (the
acquiring bank) and a customer&rsquo;s bank (the issuing bank).</p>

<h2>merchant account</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account">merchant account</a> is a type
of bank account provided by an acquiring bank which allows merchants to accept
payments via credit card.</p>

<h2>interchange fee</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_fee">interchange fee</a> is
the fee paid to the issuing bank by the acquiring bank.  The amount varies by
card type, card brand, transaction amount, and other factors and is set by the
card associations like Visa, Mastercard, or Discover.</p>

<h2>discount rate</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://merchantwarehouse.com/understanding-merchant-account-discount-rates">discount rate</a>
is made up of several different fees which are charged to the merchant.  This
usually includes the interchange fee.  The discount rate is a fixed
percentage-based fee charged for each transaction.  A portion of the fee is
passed to the acquiring bank who likely passes a portion to the issuing bank
who in turn passes a portion to the credit card association.</p>

<p>Rates are influenced by many things including the level of risk. Brick and
mortar stores where a card is physically present are considered the lowest
risk.  There are three categories of transaction types based on risk and each
have a different discount rate: qualified, mid-qualified and non-qualified.
Internet transactions are non-qualified which is the most expensive category.</p>

<h2>basis point</h2>

<p>1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account#Terms_to_know">basis point</a>
is 1%.  A term sometimes used when discussing the discount rate.</p>

<h2>Average Ticket Size (AVT)</h2>

<p>The might make more sense to outsiders if they had called it Average
Transaction Size.  Its the total monthly sales amount divided by the total
number of transactions for that month.  Merchant account rates and fees are
often based on a merchant&rsquo;s monthly AVT.</p>

<h2>PCI DSS</h2>

<p>PCI stands for Payment Card Industry.  DSS stands for Data Security Standard.
It is a set of security standards for organizations who handle cardholder
information.  It is defined by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)
which was formed in 2006 by the major card associations.  Note that there is a
difference between being compliant being validated as compliant.  Validation is
done annually by a Qualified Security Accessor (QSA) who creates a Report on
Compliance (ROC) for organizations handle lots of transactions or a
Self-Assessment Questionaire (SAQ) for companies handling less transactions.</p>
