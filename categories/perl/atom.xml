    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I always <code>use strict</code> in all my code.  But what does that actually mean?</p>

<h1>Enables strict refs</h1>

<p>Strict refs generates runtime errors when you use symbolic references.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'refs';
$ref = "yarrr matey";
print $$ref;        # runtime error but without strict refs this is ok
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict vars</h1>

<p>Strict vars generates a compile time error if you access a variable that was
not declared or is not fully qualified.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'vars';
$X::foo = 1;         # ok because its fully qualified
my $foo = 10;        # ok because my() was used.
$baz = 9;            # compile time error because $baz not declared before
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict subs</h1>

<p>Strict subs generates a compile time error if you use a bareword identifier
that&rsquo;s not a subroutine, unless it is a simple identifier (no colons) and that
it appears in curly braces or on the left hand side of the => symbol.</p>

<pre><code>no strict 'subs';
my $a = boop;
print $a; 
sub boop { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;boop&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf;      # &lt;--- compile time error here
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above generates a compile time error on line 2.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf(); 
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo; which is probably the desired output.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>The short version for the impatient</h1>

<ul>
<li> <code>my()</code> creates a local variable</li>
<li> <code>our()</code> creates a package variable</li>
<li> <code>local()</code> temporarily changes the local value of a global variable</li>
<li> The above is mostly true.</li>
</ul>


<h1>The long version for the irrepressibly quixotic</h1>

<h2>my()</h2>

<p><code>my</code> declares the listed variable to be local to the enclosing block, file,
or <code>eval</code>.  That is to say its <em>scope</em> is local.  This kind of variable is
known as a <em>lexical variable</em>.  Note that lexical variables are hidden from
subroutines which are called from within the enclosing block.  This is known as
<em>lexical scoping</em>.</p>

<h2>our()</h2>

<p><code>our</code> creates an alias to a <em>package variable</em>.  The alias is local to the
enclosing block, file, or <code>eval</code>.  That is to say the alias is lexically scoped
just like any lexical variable.  However a package variable belongs to a
package.  It can be accessed from anywhere if you use its fully qualified name.
Here are two examples of fully qualified package variables:</p>

<pre><code>$main::a
%MyPackage::boop
</code></pre>

<p>Note that package variables are also global variables.</p>

<h2>local()</h2>

<p><code>local</code> gives temporary values to global variables.  It does not create a local
variable.  It is most commonly used when you want to locally modify a global
variable such as one of the punctuation variables.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>{ 
    local $| = 1; # enable autoflush for STDOUT
    say "hi mom";
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>local</code> modifies the listed variable to be local to the enclosing block,
file, or <code>eval</code> &mdash; AND to any subroutine called from within that block.  This
is known as <em>dynamic scoping</em>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/16/disagree-interview/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/16/disagree-interview</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;m writing about something I noticed while doing interviews recently.</p>

<p>If I disagree with a decision a company made, I need to jump into that with
both feet.  There is sometimes an instinct to say &ldquo;I suppose I can live with
that&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know enough about why this choice was made to complain about
it&rdquo;.  But the goal is not to complain or to highlight their ignorance or to
have an argument.</p>

<p>Disagreeing starts a discussion.  This creates an opportunity to do 2 things.</p>

<p>First, it allows me to show case what I know.  The fact I have an opinion shows
I have worked on this problem before and over the course of the discussion I
will be able to demonstrate I understand the pros and cons of the different
options and have expertise there.</p>

<p>Second, I will come to understand why the company got into the position they
are in.  Usually there is a good reason.  If it was made through ignorance I
will find out if are they open to fixing the problem &mdash; subject to priorities
of course.  I may also learn if they are interested in my opinion or are
looking for a soldier who follows orders.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/14/interview-questions/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/14/interview-questions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently relocated from London to the Chicago area so I have been doing
interviews.  When I interview a potential client or employer I carry this list of
questions with me.  Most of the questions I have taken from other sources
online.  I have listed them in roughly the order I ask them.</p>

<h1>Understanding the job</h1>

<ul>
<li>What will I be doing every day (precisely)?</li>
<li>Why are you hiring? New product? Scaling? Someone quit?</li>
<li>Who will I report to?</li>
<li>Who will I be working with?  How big are the teams?</li>
<li>What are my boss' goals for the next 6 months/year?</li>
<li>What is the key metric for the company? For my group? For my boss?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Understanding the culture</h1>

<ul>
<li>How do you build software?  Where do requirements and features come from?
Is it a very formal process or is there no process?</li>
<li>What problems does the group have that need to be solved?</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to fix legacy code and problems that exist?</li>
<li>What do you wish you had known before starting work here?</li>
<li>Whats the worst part of this job and whats the coolest thing you have built here, personally?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Tools and best practices</h1>

<ul>
<li>What tools are being used?

<ul>
<li>bug tracking</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>which version of Perl</li>
<li>what operating system</li>
<li>why were those choices made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to use the latest stuff from CPAN?</li>
<li>Are there tests?</li>
<li>Are there automated tests?</li>
<li>What is deployment like?</li>
<li>Is Moose used? OO?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is there any allowance for remote work?</li>
<li>Are there core business hours?</li>
<li>Will I be oncall?</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/02/28/duckduckgo/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/02/28/duckduckgo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instant answers are those little boxes at the top of the DuckDuckGo search
results page.  I made one for discovering international calling codes &mdash; or
dialing codes if you prefer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-singapore.png" width="700" height="424">
<img src="/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-down-under.png" width="700" height="424"></p>

<p>If you want to hack on DuckDuckGo and add your own instant answer its pretty
simple to <a href="http://duckduckhack.com">get started</a>.  You can use Vagrant and
VirtualBox to get a complete working dev environment.  But if you are already
running Ubuntu or OSX the following recipe is easier:</p>

<pre><code>curl http://duckpan.org/install.pl | perl 
cpanm App::DuckPAN
duckpan installdeps # installs dependencies from DuckPAN (not CPAN) to locallib
</code></pre>

<p>Next fork the repository you want to hack on.  To choose the correct repository
think about what kind of data source you are using to generate your instant answer.</p>

<ul>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice">spice repo</a>
 if you have a real time data source like a JSON web API.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodie">goodie repo</a>
 if you generate your instant answer with code and need no network access.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">fathead repo</a>
 if your data source can be placed in a key/value store.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">longtail repo</a>
 if your data source requires a full text search.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now you can start hacking.  I&rsquo;ll show you how the capitalization instant answer
from the goodie repo works.  Below is the code.  I added comments to explain
things a bit.</p>

<pre><code>package DDG::Goodie::Capitalize;
use DDG::Goodie;

# If a DuckDuckGo search query contains any of these words at the start or
# end of the query, the 'remainder' handler below will run.
triggers startend =&gt; 'capitalize', 'uppercase', 'upper case';

# This block of code is pretty much meta data describing this instant
# answer.  Mostly it is used by https://duckduckgo.com/goodies.
zci answer_type =&gt; "capitalize";
primary_example_queries 'capitalize this';
secondary_example_queries 'uppercase that';
description 'capitalize a string';
name 'Capitalize';
code_url 'https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/Capitalize.pm';
category 'conversions';
topics 'programming';
attribution twitter =&gt; 'crazedpsyc',
            cpan    =&gt; 'CRZEDPSYC' ;

# This is is where the magic happens.  $_ contains the query minus the
# trigger word.  The return value from this sub shows up on the DuckDuckGo
# search results page as an instant answer.
handle remainder =&gt; sub { uc ($_) };
</code></pre>

<p>To test your new instant answer you can launch a little web server with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>duckpan server
</code></pre>

<p>Then open your favorite web browser and surf to
<a href="http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs">http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs</a> and you should
see something like this:</p>
