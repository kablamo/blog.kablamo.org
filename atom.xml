    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use and love OSX growl and Ubuntu notify style desktop notifications.  They
are gorgeous.  But they are also distracting and after a few vibrant and
whimsical but fleeting seconds they are gone forever and you have no way to get
them back.</p>

<p>A more useful (and less glorious) way to receive notifications is in your
<a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> status bar.  tmux is the brilliant
successor to the venerable screen which hasn&rsquo;t been actively developed for
quite a while.</p>

<p>Here is how I configure notifications in my .tmux.conf file:</p>

<pre><code>set -g status-interval 15    
set -g status-right !exec my_shell_script
</code></pre>

<p>This tells tmux to run <code>my_shell_script</code> every 15 seconds.  It displays the
first line of output from the shell script.  Now I can get unobtrusive status
updates which don&rsquo;t go away. And if I ate a good breakfast, feel rested, and
have the wind at my back I can write some code to log my notifications to a
file so that I don&rsquo;t miss any.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas that might be useful which I might someday do maybe perhaps
possibly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Status updates when someone says your name on irc</li>
<li>Status updates when jenkins tests fail</li>
<li>Status updates when people push code live</li>
<li>Status updates when people merge branches</li>
</ul>


<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Also don&rsquo;t miss the tmux <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">powerline</a>
status bar.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/25/plenv/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/25/plenv</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I started breaking out of my Perl-only isolation bubble and dabbling
with other languages. I was surprised how easy and comfortable other languages
are. I think its because these days good ideas spread from one language to the
next incredibly fast. Even in a new language when I reach for a tool I can
usually find some Perl technology analogue.</p>

<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve been a perlbrew person for a long time and it has served me
well.  Ruby has its own version of perlbrew called rbenv which is pretty great.
But actually it seems every language has a clone of rbenv.</p>

<ul>
<li>Python has pyenv.</li>
<li>PHP has phpenv.</li>
<li>Node has ndenv.</li>
<li>Java has jenv.</li>
<li>Perl has plenv.</li>
</ul>


<p>So I thought, what the heck &mdash; lets try that out.  The nice thing
is all the envs have pretty much the same command line options and the same
approach to managing dependencies.  I thought it might be calming and soothing
for my brain to have one way of doing things.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/riywo/anyenv">Anyenv</a> just a second ago as I was
writing this.  It claims it will manage all my envs. Looks like brilliant
stuff. Fortune favors the bold. (I eat danger for breakfast.)  I&rsquo;ll try it.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/riywo/anyenv ~/.anyenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.anyenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.my_profile
echo 'eval "$(anyenv init -)"'               &gt;&gt; ~/.my_profile
exec bash -l
anyenv install rbenv    # ruby
anyenv install plenv    # perl
anyenv install pyenv    # python
anyenv install phpenv   # php
anyenv install ndenv    # nodejs
anyenv install denv     # dunno
anyenv install jenv     # java
exec bash -l            # &lt;-- useful trick btw
anyenv versions
</code></pre>

<p>Ok now I have all the envs.  But I want to actually do some work with plenv.
Lets see if I can do that.</p>

<pre><code>plenv install --list  # list all the potential perl versions you can use
plenv install 5.19.6  # install perl v5.19.6
plenv rehash          # reload the shell environment with the new perl
plenv global 5.19.6   # use v5.19.6 everywhere by default
plenv local  5.19.6   # use v5.19.6 in this directory for this project
plenv install-cpanm   # install cpanm for this version of perl
plenv rehash          #
plenv which cpanm     # see where cpanm is installed. should be ~/.anyenv
</code></pre>

<p>Now I will install the dependencies for my project.  I will manage them with
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton">Carton</a>.</p>

<pre><code>cpanm Carton          # install carton for this version of perl
plenv list-modules
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I need to create a <code>cpanfile</code>.  There are all kinds of cool
things you can do in this file, but with your permision I will begin with baby
steps.  Here is mine cpanfile for now:</p>

<pre><code>requires "Catalyst";
requires "Plack";
requires "DBD::SQLite";
</code></pre>

<p>And then I run carton to install these modules locally into local/lib/perl5.</p>

<pre><code>carton               # install all the dependencies from the cpanfile
ls local/lib/perl5/  # see all the new modules installed here
plenv list-modules   # see mountains of installed stuff
cd /tmp
plenv list-modules   # see nothing installed except Carton
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that a carton.snapshot file was created.  If I look inside, I can see a
list of all my project dependencies, and all their dependencies, etc all the
way down to the first turtle &mdash; AND there are version numbers for everything.</p>

<pre><code># carton snapshot format: version 1.0
DISTRIBUTIONS
Apache-LogFormat-Compiler-0.13
  pathname: K/KA/KAZEBURO/Apache-LogFormat-Compiler-0.13.tar.gz
    provides:
      Apache::LogFormat::Compiler 0.13
    requirements:
      CPAN::Meta 0
      CPAN::Meta::Prereqs 0
      Module::Build 0.38
...blah biddee blah etc...
</code></pre>

<p>I can add <code>cpanfile</code> and <code>cpanfile.snapshot</code> to my git repo.  Now when I deploy
or share the code, the user at the destination can run Carton and they will end
up with the exact dependencies with the exact same version numbers I had. This
way I can be sure my code will run as successfully for them as it did for me.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/24/monit/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/24/monit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your website goes down, you want to find out fast.  There are a few ways to
accomplish this, but I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit">monit</a>.  Monit is a
mature unix monitoring daemon and it gives me the ability not only get alerts
but to restart services that go down.</p>

<p>Monit has lotsa power and options and you can read about all of them on
the man page.  Or if you don&rsquo;t want to mess around with that you can pay them
for a <a href="https://mmonit.com/screenshots/">pretty web admin interface</a> and some
phone/tablet apps for a one time fee of € 65.  Another simpler and I think less
powerful option is <a href="http://monitis.com/?affiliate=1303230640">monitor.us</a>.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pay.  So I installed monit like this:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install monit
</code></pre>

<p>The configuration file for monit lives at <code>/etc/monit/monitrc</code>.  You probably
don&rsquo;t need to bother with that.  When monit runs, it looks in
<code>/etc/monit/conf.d</code> and executes any scripts it finds in there.  Like many
people I&rsquo;m running nginx in front of my Starman web apps.  So I want monitor
both of those processes.</p>

<p>Here is how to do that.  Created a script named <code>/etc/monit/confd/nginx</code>:</p>

<pre><code>check process nginx with pidfile /var/run/nginx.pid

    start program = "/etc/init.d/nginx start"
    stop  program = "/etc/init.d/nginx stop"

    alert kablamo@example.com with mail-format {
           from: monit@example.com
        subject: monit alert: $SERVICE $EVENT $DATE
        message: $DESCRIPTION
    }

    if failed port 80 protocol HTTP
        request /
        with timeout 7 seconds
        then restart
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a second script named <code>/etc/monit/conf.d/mywebapp</code>.  Its very
similar.  This assumes you are running your web app as the user <code>web</code> on
localhost port 22222.</p>

<pre><code>check process mywebapp with pidfile /var/run/mywebapp.pid

    start program = "/etc/init.d/mywebapp start" as uid web and gid web
    stop  program = "/etc/init.d/mywebapp stop"  as uid web and gid web

    alert kablamo@example.com with mail-format {
           from: monit@example.com
        subject: monit alert: $SERVICE $EVENT $DATE
        message: $DESCRIPTION
    }

    if failed port 22222 protocol HTTP
        request /
        with timeout 7 seconds
        then restart
</code></pre>

<p>With these scripts, anytime your processes disappear or stop working you will
get email and monit will try to restart them.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m paranoid.  So I created a third monit script to do an end to end test in case
something ever gets misconfigured somewhere. <code>/etc/monit/conf.d/end2end</code>:</p>

<pre><code>check host networthify.com with address 71.19.156.131

    alert kablamo@example.com with mail-format {
           from: monit@monit@example.com
        subject: monit alert: $SERVICE $EVENT $DATE
        message: $DESCRIPTION
    }

    if failed port 80 protocol HTTP
        request /
        with timeout 9 seconds
        then alert
</code></pre>

<p>Suggestions for improvment?</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/22/rex/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/22/rex</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been playing with <a href="http://www.rexify.org/">Rex</a> and wanted to
write down some of my initial thoughts.</p>

<p>Rex is a devops tool that helps you manage your servers.  Its similar to
Puppet Lab&rsquo;s <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/mcollective">mcollective</a> tool or
<a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/">ansible</a>.  You can easily run commands on
your entire fleet of boxen or just on certain subgroups.  And you can run
them in parallel which saves you giant baskets of time.</p>

<p>The big advantage for People Who Prefer Perl (PWPP) is that Rex is written and
configured with Perl. So for the most part you don&rsquo;t need to spend a lot of time
learning yet another DSL.</p>

<p>Another happy positive is that you don&rsquo;t need to install any software on your
servers. Installation is simple:</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install libssh2-1-dev
$ cpanm Rex
</code></pre>

<p>Configuration is also simple &mdash; at least if you know Perl.  The
Rex configuration file is named &lsquo;Rexfile&rsquo; and its syntax is Perl with some
extra Rexy sugar methods thrown in. And I feel the sugar and general API for
Rex is fairly well done.  Here is an example Rexfile:</p>

<pre><code># Configure the default user and your ssh keys.  The default user can be
# overridden on the command line with the -u option.
user "joe";
private_key "/home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa";
public_key "/home/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub";
key_auth;

# Cofigure server groups
group prod =&gt; "webserver", "mailserver", "dbserver";
group dev  =&gt; "pancake[1-3]", "narwhale[1-3]", "honeybadger[1-3]";

# Run commands in parallel on up to 100 servers at one time.  This can be
# overridden on the command line with the -t option.
parallelism 100;

# Create tasks.  This task runs against all servers by default.  This can
# be overridden on the command line with the -G or -H options.
task 'uptime', group =&gt; 'all', sub {
    my $output = run "uptime";
    say $output;
};
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that Perl&rsquo;s &lsquo;say&rsquo; command is available by default.  &lsquo;run&rsquo; is a Rex
sugar method which accepts a shell command and returns the output &mdash; similar
to Capture::Tiny.</p>

<p>Here is a command line example which runs the &lsquo;uptime&rsquo; task as the &lsquo;root&rsquo; user
on each server in the &lsquo;dev&rsquo; group:</p>

<pre><code>$ rex -G dev -u root uptime
    pancake1:  16:42:05 up 221 days,  9:49,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale2:  16:42:05 up 8 days,  3:28,  4 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale3:  16:42:05 up 17 days,  3:57,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.01, 0.00
honeybadger1:  16:42:05 up 80 days,  3:29,  1 user,  load average: 0.09, 0.06, 0.01
    pancake3:  16:42:05 up 137 days,  7:49,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
   narwhale1:  16:42:05 up 65 days,  5:30,  2 users,  load average: 0.46, 0.41, 0.37
honeybadger3:  16:42:04 up 15 days,  4:49,  1 user,  load average: 2.00, 2.00, 2.00
    pancake2:  16:42:04 up 1 day,  2:23,  3 users,  load average: 1.38, 1.35, 1.30
honeybadger2:  16:42:05 up 39 days,  1:24,  1 user,  load average: 0.08, 0.06, 0.01
</code></pre>

<p>Rex is fantastic for ad-hoc commands.  But it also has a great set of libraries
for doing much more like installing debian packages, user management,
virtualization, and managing EC2 boxes.  I have to say I&rsquo;m deeply attracted to
its simplicity &mdash; especially after dealing with Puppet&rsquo;s complicated and weird
DSL.</p>

<p>If anyone uses Rex to manage more than 50 servers, I would love to get in touch
with you and ask a few questions.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/19/learning-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/19/learning-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just completed UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Software as a Service class (via
<a href="http://edx.com">edX.com</a>).  I had a great experience and highly recommend
it.</p>

<p>The class is a tour of all the tools Ruby developers use to create and
deploy websites.  It assumes you already know how to program at a fairly high
level but not necessarily in Ruby.  I have no plans to stop writing Perl code
(which I love).  I just wanted to broaden my horizons, have some fun, and
increase my <a href="http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">luck surface area</a>.</p>

<p>Hands up, who uses what they learned from university classes in their current
job?  No one right?  While online education is clearly the future I was
initially sceptical that a traditional, old school (hah) institution like
Berkeley was innovative enough to do a good job.</p>

<p>I underestimated them.  This class was refreshingly current and practical.  I
got an introduction to a tsunami of tools. I learned to use Ruby, Rails, Rake,
Heroku, ActiveRecord, HAML, SASS, RSpec, Cucumber, and Capybara.  They also
explained REST, DRY, agile iterative development processes, and other stuff I
can&rsquo;t remember right now.</p>

<p>Another thing they got right is we were able to submit our homework over and
over again until we got all the answers.  And the ability to play
lectures at double speed is every bit as brilliant as I imagined it would be.
I wish I had this super power on YouTube.  I was also happy to see the course
supplied students with an Ubuntu powered virtual machine preconfigured with all
the necessary software.</p>

<p>I only had a few minor complaints.  My biggest is that the course didn&rsquo;t spend
any time on sysadmin topics like rbenv and bundler.  I purposely avoided using
the virtual machine so that I would learn that stuff.  Knowing how to use your
tools and configure your environment is a crucial part of being a good
programmer.  This can perhaps be forgiven though since it was only a 5 week
class and we raced through every topic like our pants were on fire.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a fun experience at a great price (free) and I recommend it.
My next class is Chinese History.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/13/go</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been in a rabbit hole for the last week.  I started by looking at Docker
(<a href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/13/docker/">See my previous post</a>).  It turns
out Docker is written in Go and so somehow I ended up learning
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>.  Well &ldquo;learning&rdquo; is an overstatement.  I&rsquo;ve read
about it for a few days and wrote a tiny bit of code.</p>

<p>But anyway, the coolest thing about Go so far is its decentralized libraries.
<em>Centralized</em> collections of libraries have been all the rage the last few years
and it seems like all the languages have gotten hip to that &mdash; CPAN, rubygems,
pypi, npm, etc.</p>

<p>But one of the biggest problems with publishing Perl modules on CPAN is how
difficult it is to do.  Sure its easy after you figure out the PAUSE website
exists, create a PAUSE account, read all the Dist::Zilla docs and some of the
source code, and write your own personalized plugin.  After that it just takes
one little command.</p>

<h1>How it works in Go</h1>

<p>If you want to use some libraries in your Go code, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import (
    "log" 
    "time"
    "errors"
    "github.com/dotcloud/docker"
    "github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient"
)
</code></pre>

<p>The first 3 are core libraries distributed as part of Go.  But the last two you
have to download and install yourself.  Doing that is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>export GOROOT=$HOME/go
go get github.com/dotcloud/docker
</code></pre>

<p>This downloads all the dependencies too.  Of course.</p>

<p>The next question you will ask me is how do people learn about new libraries in
a decentralized world?  There are websites like
<a href="http://gowalker.org/">http://gowalker.org/</a> which scrape GitHub&rsquo;s recent updates
page.  They also do this for BitBucket, Google Project Hosting, and a couple
other sites.</p>

<p>This new language has shiny modern features and is very easy to get up and
running.</p>

    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/13/docker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been in a rabbit hole for the last week.  I started looking at
<a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>.</p>

<p>Its a really interesting project that all the hosting providers seem to be
moving towards.  Its helpful at first to think of Docker as a really fast and
small virtual machine.  You can put an operating system in a virtual machine,
setup all the dependencies and permissions, and then configure and install your
app.  Its encapsulates your web app and makes it easy to move around.
Thats what docker does too except a docker container is an operating system
primitive &ndash; an <a href="http://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a>.  Which means its much faster
and smaller than a virtual machine and that makes it much easier to work with.</p>

<p>Docker also has a builtin version control system.  You can install a base
operating system like Ubuntu in your container and then commit that change.
Then you can install some dependencies and commit that change.  This commit
history also allows you to reuse different commits across different containers.</p>

<p>Docker also has builtin deployment that allows you to push your containers to
public (or private) repositories similar to CPAN or Ruby gems or pypi.</p>

<p>But I said this was a rabbit hole.  Because when I started playing with Docker
I realized its written in Go.  So I started learning <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>.
More on that tomorrow.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/11/12/linux_ate_my_ram</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can never remember how to know how much free memory I have.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel claims most of the operating system&rsquo;s memory.  That doesn&rsquo;t
mean the operating system is out of memory.  It means the kernel has claimed it
and is managing it.  The problem is that the Linux kernel defines &lsquo;free&rsquo; memory
differently than any reasonable user.  There are excellent shiny reasons for
that, but as a user I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>

<pre><code>~ ⚡ free -m 
            total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          3822       2066       1755          0        147       1125
-/+ buffers/cache:        793       3029
Swap:         3394          0       3394
</code></pre>

<p>Experienced users and sysadmins will know from this means my system currently
has 3822 MB of total memory and 3029 MB of free memory.  Errr.  What?  See
<a href="http://www.linuxatemyram.com">linuxatemyram.com</a> for a more detailed
explanation.</p>

<p>I think the world deserves something easier to deal with.  So I wrote &lsquo;mem&rsquo;.
Use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>~ ⚡ mem
   927 MB used (24%)
  3823 MB total
</code></pre>

<p>Its a bash function.  I put the following in my

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I added a <strong>git-vspark</strong> script to my App::Git::Spark CPAN module.  It does the
same thing as <a href="https://github.com/kablamo/git-spark">git-spark</a> but instead of
normal horizontal sparklines, it uses &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; sparklines.  Here&rsquo;s what that
looks like:</p>

<pre><code>$ git vspark --months 8 batman
Commits by batman over the last 8 months
total: 233   avg: 29   max: 69
 12 ██▋
 18 ████
 69 ███████████████▏
 59 ████████████▉
 16 ███▌
 28 ██████▏
 12 ██▋
 19 ████▎
</code></pre>

<p>This effect is achieved using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Term::Vspark">Term::Vspark</a>.  Its companion module
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Term::Spark">Term::Spark</a> is a small pure Perl
replacement for Zach Holman&rsquo;s original <a href="https://github.com/holman/spark">spark</a>
implementation and it now powers my git-spark script.</p>

<p>These libraries were fun little projects developed over the past few weeks
mainly by <a href="https://github.com/LuRsT">Gil Gonçalves</a> with a few pull requests
from myself.  Having them available on CPAN means you can easily use sparklines
in your own Perl code.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/02/28/chinese-flashcards/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/02/28/chinese-flashcards</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There seem to be quite a few Perl people learning Chinese so maybe this will be
relevant here.</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://iijo.org">IIJO</a> which is a Perl powered website that does 3
sided flashcards (Chinese, English, and Pinyin).</p>

<p>The main advantage IIJO has over Anki and other flashcard sites is that you can
pick your flashcards from a dictionary so you don&rsquo;t have to type all that stuff
in yourself.   It allows you to share word lists with others and the built in
dictionary means that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about the accuracy and
completeness of other people who share wordlists.</p>

<p>The site does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>
like Anki.  But it has a different simpler user interface because Anki&rsquo;s 4
buttons after each flashcard <em>stresses me out.</em></p>

<p>If you want, you can just play with the <a href="http://iijo.org/dictionary">Chinese/English dictionary</a>.<br/>
The goal here is to be able to look up a word then add it easily to one of your
existing word lists.</p>

<p>If you think there is something missing, check out the project on
<a href="http://github.org/kablamo/iijo.org">GitHub</a> and send me a pull request.  I&rsquo;m
using Perl, Catalyst, and SQLite.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things on my todo list:</p>

<ul>
<li>More analytics/stats/data for measuring progress using D3</li>
<li>Speech/pronunciation samples</li>
<li>Export to Anki</li>
<li>Some way to learn phrases instead of just characters</li>
</ul>


<h1>Vampires and zombies</h1>

<p>Btw, here&rsquo;s an interesting thing I learned about the Chinese language: the word
for <code>vampire</code> is the same word thats used for <code>zombie</code>.</p>

<center><p style="margin-bottom: .5em; font-size: 4em; font-weight: bold;">僵尸</p></center>


<p>This is because the Chinese merged the two concepts into a single vampire
zombie monster.  So Chinese zombies are stiff and walk around with their hands
straight out.  But they also bite their victim&rsquo;s necks and suck their blood
passing on the zombie infection.</p>

<p>They are also fast and angry and they often do kung fu.  You can&rsquo;t
kill them of course, however you can put them to sleep if you write a spell on a
yellow piece of paper and put it on their forehead.  But if it falls off, they
wake up and get angry again.  Strangest of all is that they do little
hops like bunnies instead of walking.</p>

<p>I highly recommend Liao Yiwo&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Corpse-Walker-Stories-Bottom/dp/0307388379/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362603639&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=corpse+walker"><em>Corpse Walker,</em></a>
which tells the fascinating history and origin of Chinese zombies.  You can read more
about jiangshi on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi">Wikipedia</a>.  And of
course there are YouTube videos:</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/02/20/how-to-learn-dist-zilla/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/02/20/how-to-learn-dist-zilla</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla">Dist::Zilla</a> for a
couple years.  It&rsquo;s a powerful way to automate CPAN releases.</p>

<p>But learning how to use it was not as easy as I hoped.</p>

<p>I remember when <code>Dist::Zilla</code> first debuted.  It was very exciting.  But I think
I may have drank too much of the cool aid becuase my expectations were very
high when I finally sat down to learn it.  I expected my experience to be
composed entirely of rainbows and puppy dog tails.</p>

<h2>Writing your own dist.ini or PluginBundle is hard</h2>

<p>Instead I found that creating a dist.ini or PluginBundle is fairly hard.  There
are a huge number of plugins and it&rsquo;s difficult for a newcomer to know which
are old, which are new, and how they work together.  If you look, for example,
at <code>Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN</code> it uses 23 different plugins and the
<em>synopsis</em> is 132 lines long.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it was not reasonable to expect I could build something
comparable after a few minutes of perusing the docs.  It&rsquo;s more complex than
that.  So if you are looking to quickly add <code>Dist::Zilla</code> to your toolchain, you
need to use a PluginBundle and not write your own.</p>

<h2>How to quickly add Dist::Zilla to your toolchain</h2>

<p>One way is to just use <code>Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Basic</code>.  But this was not like
the promised land I had been dreaming of.  I wanted more.  So I kept looking.</p>

<p>Happily, there is a PluginBundle which I think works well as a reusable
component suitable for public consumption thats also very configurable.  I
doubt it&rsquo;s well known because the name sounds very personal.  That module is,
of course,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN">Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN</a>.</p>

<p>I think the workflow it uses will work for many people.  Even if it
doesn&rsquo;t, reading the code is a great way to learn how to write your own
PluginBundle.  And because it&rsquo;s so comprehensive it&rsquo;s like having a up-to-date
map of the state of the art in <code>Dist::Zilla</code> plugins and how they work
together.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what my dist.ini looks like:</p>

<pre><code>name    = App-Git-Ribbon
author  = Eric Johnson &lt;cpan at iijo dot nospamthanks dot org&gt;
license = Perl_5
copyright_holder = Eric Johnson
main_module = lib/App/Git/Ribbon.pm

[@DAGOLDEN]
no_spellcheck = 1
AutoMetaResources.bugtracker.rt = 0
AutoMetaResources.repository.github = user:kablamo
AutoMetaResources.bugtracker.github = user:kablamo
weaver_config = @FLORA

    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/02/02/git-ribbon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a little Perl script called
<a href="https://github.com/kablamo/git-ribbon">git-ribbon</a> to help me review the
latest changes in a git repository.</p>

<p>The way I used to review changes was by reading through the <code>git log</code>.  I try
to do this every morning at work to keep up with whats going on.  But I was
having a few problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Its hard to know exactly which changes are new.</li>
<li>I want to review commits in the order they happened (instead of most recent first).</li>
<li><code>git log</code> diff output can be hard to read and may not have enough context
&mdash; sometimes I want a side by side diff like I get from <code>vimdiff</code> or <code>git
difftool</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Basically I wanted a quick and easy way to review the latest changes in a way
that feels a little more like an RSS feed.  So I wrote this script.</p>

<h2>How to use git-ribbon</h2>

<p><strong>First</strong> mark your current place in the commit history.  This command will
place a tag named _ribbon at origin/master.  Basically its a bookmark at your
current location.</p>

<pre><code>⚡ git ribbon --save
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Next</strong>, pull the latest changes made by your fellow conspirators from the
remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>⚡ git pull
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Then</strong> use <code>git ribbon</code> to review only the changes that have occurred since _ribbon:</p>

<pre><code>⚡ git ribbon

lib/Networth/Out/RealCost.pm
root/html/calculator/realCost.tt

press 's' to skip 
</code></pre>

<p>The script will pause and wait for input when it prints <code>press 's' to skip</code>.
If you type anything other than <code>s</code>, it will show you the side by side diff
using <code>git difftool</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8457314152_7f8b3c955c_b.jpg" title="click to view large version"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8457314152_7f8b3c955c.jpg" width="500" height="201" alt="vimdiff"></a></p>

<p>After you have reviewed all the changes, be sure to mark your place again so
its ready to go next time you want to do a pull:</p>

<pre><code>git ribbon --save
</code></pre>

<h2>Bonus tips</h2>

<p>In your .gitconfig try this:</p>

<pre><code>[diff]
    tool = vimdiff
</code></pre>

<p>The default colors for vimdiff look like they were created by strange clowns so
try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>⚡ mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/
⚡ wget https://github.com/kablamo/dotfiles/blob/master/links/.vim/colors/iijo.vim -O ~/.vim/colors/iijo.vim
⚡ echo "colorscheme iijo" &gt;&gt; ~/.vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>Then learn to use vimdiff:</p>

<ul>
<li>To switch windows type <code>ctl-w l</code> and <code>ctl-w h</code>.
For more help type <code>:help window-move-cursor</code>.</li>
<li>To open and close folds type <code>zo</code> and <code>zc</code>.
For more help type <code>:help fold-commands</code>.</li>
<li>To close vimdiff with less typing try <code>ZZ</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Alternatives to vimdiff</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to invest the time just yet to learn vim, use an alternative like meld, opendiff,
p4merge, xxdiff, etc.  Side by side diffs are worth it!</p>

<h2>See also</h2>

<p>This script was inspired by a great <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2011/10/21/ribbon-and-catchup-reading-new-commits.html">blog
post</a>
on gitready.com which has a number of awesome git tricks for both beginners and
advanced users.</p>

<p>I also ended up writing a <a href="https://github.com/kablamo/vim-ribbon">vim plugin</a>
that is probably better user experience if you very comfortable in vim.</p>

    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/01/27/git-spark-revisited</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://blog.kablamo.org/git-spark-plots-your-commit-history/">few days ago</a>
I wrote about my <a href="https://gist.github.com/4598480">git-spark</a> Perl script.  It
counts how many commits a user has in a git project and makes a little graph
and displays it on the command line.</p>

<p>However I also said it wasn&rsquo;t very useful becuase you can&rsquo;t compare one graph
with another because the scale changes when different graphs have different min
and max values.  For example these two data series produce identical graphs
despite have very different data.</p>

<pre><code>⚡ spark 1 2 3 4 5
▁▂▄▆█
⚡ spark 10 20 30 40 50
▁▂▄▆█
</code></pre>

<p>So I put on my thinking cap and came up with the following solution:</p>

<pre><code>⚡ spark 50 1 1 2 3 4 5
█▁▁▁▁▁▁
⚡ spark 50 1 10 20 30 40 50
█▁▂▃▅▆█
</code></pre>

<p>I just need to prepend a max and a min to the data to get consistent scaling
and now I can compare graphs.</p>

<p>For git-spark, I now assume the min is zero and you can pass in the max using
the &mdash;scale option.  (Note that I chopped off the max/min characters from
the spark output as they are distracting.)</p>

<p>I also decided to print out the number of commits which helps with the
scaling issue.  And while I was in there I got it to calculate the total,
average, and maximum number of commits for that duration.</p>

<p>Here is an example.  It doesn&rsquo;t really need the &mdash;scale option because the data
is so close anyway, but it shows how to use it:</p>

<pre><code>⚡ git spark --days 14 --scale 23 Stegosaurus
Commits by Stegosaurus over the last 14 days
total: 95   avg: 7   max: 23
10 15 6 23 5 0 0 1 15 0 17 3 0 0
▄▅▂█▂▁▁▁▅▁▆▁▁▁
⚡ git spark --days 14 --scale 23 Triceratops
Commits by Triceratops over the last 14 days
total: 90   avg: 7   max: 22
1 12 3 11 3 0 0 6 16 3 13 22 0 0
▁▄▁▄▁▁▁▂▅▁▄▇▁▁
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you still need to consider the quality of commits and not just how
many there are.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently rediscovered <a href="https://github.com/holman/spark">spark</a>, Zach Holman&rsquo;s
cool little sparklines graphing tool for the command line.  I used a little
Perl to mash it up with &lsquo;git log&rsquo; and came up with
<a href="https://gist.github.com/4598480">git-spark</a> which works like this:</p>

<pre><code>⚡ git spark --hours 8

<pre><code>⚡ git spark -h

        -h --help       show this message
</code></pre>

<p>It was fun to build, but afterward I realized its totally useless.  Clearly
&lsquo;commits&rsquo; are a problematic metric.  But its much worse than that.  The peaks
on the graph are relative to the lows on the same graph.  So a peak on one
graph has no relation to a peak on another.  That means I can&rsquo;t compare one
sparkline with another.</p>

<p>Back to the drawing board.  I&rsquo;ll have to come up with something else.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/01/19/how-to-resolve-circular-dependencies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Circular dependencies happen when your library requires a library which
requires your library.  Here&rsquo;s an example.  Lets say you have 2 packages:</p>

<p><strong>AlienPlanet.pm</strong></p>

<pre><code>package AlienPlanet;
use Moose;
use Dinosaurs;          # &lt;--- Circular dependency
sub has_dinosaurs {1}
1;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Dinosaurs.pm</strong></p>

<pre><code>package Dinosaurs;
use Moose;
use AlienPlanet;        # &lt;--- Circular dependency
sub has_rabies {1}
1;
</code></pre>

<p>If you try to compile this, you get the following warning:</p>

<pre><code>⚡ perl -c lib/AlienPlanet.pm 
Subroutine has_dinosaurs redefined at lib/AlienPlanet.pm line 5.
lib/AlienPlanet.pm syntax OK
</code></pre>

<p>In this case its obvious where the problem is.</p>

<p>But if the package you included, included 25 other libraries, which included
other libraries, which included your original library &mdash; then its harder to
figure out where the circle is.</p>

<p>Happily I discovered a good solution. First, modify <strong>AlienPlanet.pm</strong> to look
like this:</p>

<pre><code>package AlienPlanet;
sub has_dinosaurs {1}   &lt;-- swap
use Dinosaurs;          &lt;-- swap
1;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, try compiling your code again but this time with
<a href="http://perladvent.org/2011/2011-12-04.html">Carp::Always</a>:</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got a stack trace and its easy to see where your problem is.  All
thats left is figuring out how to solve it. (Fast solution: use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Class::Load">Class::Load</a> in the Dinosaurs
package.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2 bajillion times a day I want to print a hashref and see whats inside.
But every time I want to do that I have to type:</p>

<pre><code>use Data::Dumper::Concise;
print Dumper $hashref;
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, thats too much typing.  And second of all I keep forgetting to
delete my print statements when I check in.</p>

<p>Happily I recently discovered
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Devel::Dwarn">Devel::Dwarn</a> on CPAN.  It is
(basically) an alias to
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Data::Dumper::Concise">Data::Dumper::Concise</a>.</p>

<p>The name is shorter which means its slightly less typing so I am already
winning.  But thats not the best part.  Lets see how to use it.</p>

<p>On the command line I do this:</p>

<pre><code>perl -MDevel::Dwarn codeIWantToDebug.pl
</code></pre>

<p>And then in my code I do this:</p>

<pre><code>print ::Dwarn $hashref;
</code></pre>

<p>There are 2 levels of good here:</p>

<ol>
<li> Less typing.</li>
<li> When I run my code without &lsquo;perl -M&rsquo; I get compile time errors in all
 the places I forgot to remove <code>print ::Dwarn $hashref</code>.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave my first <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/ye2012/schedule?day=2012-08-20">YAPC::EU</a>
presentation this year in Frankfurt after doing a trial run at London.pm.  I
received some good questions and comments and a few new ideas.  It was a good
experience and I want to do this again.</p>

<p>My talk introduced Selenium and common problems people have when first trying
to write Selenium tests in Perl.  I also explained how I solved many of those
problems by creating
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Test::WWW::Selenium::More">Test::WWW::Selenium::More</a>.</p>

<p>The slides are available
<a href="http://kablamo.org/selenium-2012-yapceu-slides/">online</a>. Or if you need to
download them for some reason, they are hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/kablamo/selenium-2012-yapceu-slides">github</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-05-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2012/05/17/test-www-selenium-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently released
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Test::WWW::Selenium::More">Test::WWW::Selenium::More</a>
to CPAN.  It is a small collection of utilities to help you write Selenium
tests.  Here are some reasons to use it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It has a
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Test::WWW::Selenium::More::Manual">manual</a> which
provides a concise but fairly comprehensive howto guide to Selenium testing in
Perl.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses Moose so you can more easily use roles.  For example you might want
a role for methods that deal with authentication and a role for methods that
deal with payments.</p></li>
<li><p>Smarter testing with methods like wait_for_jquery() and jquery_click().  You
should never sleep() in your Selenium tests because that leads to slow tests
with random failures which leads to frustration, low morale, hair pulling, and
heavy drinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Method chaining.  Here is what this looks like:</p>

<pre><code> use Test::Most;
 use Test::WWW::Selenium::More;

 Test::WWW::Selenium::More-&gt;new()

 -&gt;note('Search google')
 -&gt;open_ok("http://www.google.com")
 -&gt;title_like(qr/Google Search/)
 -&gt;type_ok('cat pictures')
 -&gt;follow_link_ok('Search')

 -&gt;note('Check the number of results')
 -&gt;is_text_present_ok('2 bajillion results');

 done_testing;
</code></pre></li>
