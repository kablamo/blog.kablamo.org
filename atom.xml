<h1>PSGI Applications</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/PSGI/PSGI.pod">PSGI spec</a> defines
a PSGI application.</p>

<blockquote><p>A PSGI application is a Perl code reference. It takes exactly one argument,
the environment, and returns an array reference containing exactly three
values [(a status, header, and body)].</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>my $app = sub {
    my $env = shift;
    return [
        '200',
        [ 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/plain' ],
        [ "Hello World" ], # or IO::Handle-like object
    ];
};
</code></pre>

<h1>The PSGI environment hash</h1>

<p>The PSGI environment hash is a hashref with many keys.  But mostly it is the
data (headers, body, etc) from a <a href="HTTP::Request">HTTP::Request</a> which have been parsed put into
a hash for convenient access.</p>

<h1>Middleware</h1>

<p>A middleware component takes a PSGI application and runs it, passing in the
PSGI environment hash.  But before it runs the app, it gets to modify the
environment if it wants to.  And after running the app, it can modify the
response if it wants to.</p>

<h1>Plack::Middleware</h1>

<p>Middleware is a wrapper around a PSGI app.  More than one middleware can be
wrapped around an app, creating a series of layers like an
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jakob/2012/09/28/middleware-onion.png/500px-MiddlewareOnion.svg.png">onion</a>.
What makes the middleware onion a somewhat unusual construct is the event
driven / callback nature of it.  Lets look at how its implemented.</p>

<p>All middleware inherits from Plack::Middleware which is an itsy bitsy (teeny
weeny) module.  The middleware onion is created with just 2 short subroutines
(notice the <code>call()</code> and <code>prepare_app()</code> subs are written by middleware authors):</p>

<pre><code>sub wrap {
    my($self, $app, @args) = @_;
    if (ref $self) {
        $self-&gt;{app} = $app;
    } else {
        $self = $self-&gt;new({ app =&gt; $app, @args });
    }
    return $self-&gt;to_app;
}

sub to_app {
    my $self = shift;
    $self-&gt;prepare_app;
    return sub { $self-&gt;call(@_) };
}
</code></pre>

<p>How do these subs work together?  The middleware onion is sometimes constructed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>my $app = MyWebApp-&gt;new-&gt;to_app;
$app = Plack::Middleware::A-&gt;wrap($app);
$app = Plack::Middleware::B-&gt;wrap($app);
$app = Plack::Middleware::C-&gt;wrap($app);
</code></pre>

<p>But it might be more clear to write it this way</p>

<pre><code>my $app0 = MyWebApp-&gt;new-&gt;to_app;           # $app0-&gt;($env) runs the web app
$app1 = Plack::Middleware::A-&gt;wrap($app0);  # $app1-&gt;($env) calls P::M::A-&gt;call() which calls $app0-&gt;($env)
$app2 = Plack::Middleware::B-&gt;wrap($app1);  # $app2-&gt;($env) calls P::M::B-&gt;call() which calls $app1-&gt;($env)
$app3 = Plack::Middleware::C-&gt;wrap($app2);  # $app3-&gt;($env) calls P::M::C-&gt;call() which calls $app2-&gt;($env)
                                            # When the server receives a request it calls $app3-&gt;($env)
</code></pre>

<p>So when an event occurs &mdash; for example the PSGI server sees a new request &mdash; it
passes the event to the app.  The app is a chain of callbacks which run each
other.  This is clearly an example of event driven programming.</p>

<h1>Plack::Component and Plack::App</h1>

<p>Plack::Middleware inherits from Plack::Component.  So the most common use of
Plack::Component is in middleware.</p>

<p>Plack::Component can also be used as a tool for creating PSGI applications.  It
has a light dusting of code, but mostly its an interface which is implemented
by modules in the Plack::App namespace.  For example Plack::App::File is a web
app which serves static files from a root directory, and Plack::App::URLMap is
a web app which maps multiple web apps to multiple urls.</p>

<p>But notice that I am not required to use Plack::Component to create a PSGI
application. A PSGI application is just a code reference.  The PSGI spec does
not say that a PSGI application is a reference to code that inherits from
Plack::Component.</p>

<p>The nice thing about using Plack::Component to build my app is that it
provides a common interface for all PSGI apps.  Whenever I see <code>$app</code>, I
can rely on that behavior.  This is clearly important for middleware.  And it
feels good from a design point of view.</p>

<p>But its not required and it adds some complexity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/04/08/read-plack-1">Part 1 &ndash; An Overview</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/04/09/read-plack-2"><strong>Part 2 &ndash; plackup Architecture</strong></a></li>

</ul>


<h1>Plack::Runner and plackup</h1>

<p><code>plackup</code> starts a PSGI server which executes a PSGI application.  However
the script itself is just a very small wrapper around Plack::Runner which does
all the heavy lifting.  Plack::Runner</p>

<ol>
<li> parses the command line options.</li>
<li> instantiates the chosen loader class (which is in the Plack::Loader namespace).</li>
<li> instatiates the chosen server library (which is in the Plack::Handler namespace).</li>
<li> starts the PSGI server and passes it a PSGI application</li>
</ol>


<h1>Plack::Loader</h1>

<p>Loaders are responsible for instantiating and running the PSGI server.  Here are
the more interesting capabilities a <code>$loader</code> object has:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$loader-&gt;guess()</code> guesses which server library should be loaded by looking at command line opts, $ENV, and %INC.</li>
<li><code>$loader-&gt;load()</code> instantiates the server library and returns the object.</li>
<li><code>$loader-&gt;run()</code> starts the server.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Plack::Loader namespace contains 3 kinds of loaders:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plack::Loader::Delayed &ndash; delays compilation of the web app until the first request occurs</li>
<li>Plack::Loader::Restarter &ndash; reloads the server if any files are changed</li>
<li>Plack::Loader::Shotgun &ndash; foreach request, forks a child which compiles the web app and runs it</li>
</ul>


<p>I can choose which loader I want using <code>plack --loader</code></p>

<h1>Plack::Handler</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/PSGI/PSGI.pod">PSGI spec</a>
tells me that PSGI defines the interface between an application and a server.
Because the PSGI spec is (intentionally) very minimal, there is a good deal of
wiggle room to interpret how an application and a server might want to play
together.</p>

<p>A library in the Plack::Handler namespace is the place where the application
meets the server.  This layer contains all the wiggling.</p>

<p>Lets say I wrote a new server called AngryBrontosaurus and I want to be able to
use it with <code>plackup --server AngryBrontosaurus</code>.  I could implement a small
class like this:</p>

<pre><code>package Plack::Handler::AngryBrontosaurus
use strict;
use AngryBrontosaurus;

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    bless { @_ }, $class;
}

sub run {
    my ($self, $app) = @_; 
    AngryBrontosaurus-&gt;new-&gt;run($app, $self);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to make sure AngryBrontosaurus and Plack::Handler::AngryBrontosaurus
correctly implement the PSGI spec, I should also test my code with
Plack::Test::Suite.</p>

<pre><code>use Test::More;
use Plack::Test::Suite;
Plack::Test::Suite-&gt;run_server_tests('AngryBrontosaurus');
done_testing;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that while the Plack::Handler namespace contains classes for several
PSGI servers like Plack::Handler::Starman or Plack::Handler::Twiggy, it also
includes some classes like Plack::Handler::Apache2 and Plack::Handler::FCGI.
Clearly Apache2 was not written with PSGI compliance in mind, but there is glue
in the Plack::Handler::Apache2 layer to enable it to speak with PSGI compliant
applications.</p>

interact.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I write lots of code.  But I want to be better and faster at reading code.
When I had the privilege of working with @ranguard I discovered he is a code
reading <em>cheetah</em> and I always envied that.  So I&rsquo;ve decided to practice
by reading the source code of various CPAN modules.  I&rsquo;m starting with Plack.</p>

</ul>


<h1>Plack</h1>

<p>Plack describes itself as a set of tools for using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/PSGI">PSGI</a> (the Perl Server Gateway Interface).</p>

<p>The earliest release of Plack on CPAN is version 0.9000 from 2009-10-13.  There
were releases several times a week for the first <strong>two years</strong>.  Impressively, in
2012 releases were still happening roughly once a week.  In 2013 things seem to
have cooled and now releases happen about once a month.</p>

<p>The code itself is written tersely and with attention to detail.  There are
almost no comments.  In fact 43 out of 71 files have fewer than 3 comments.
Of course the code is very well written which makes comments less necessary and
nowadays there is quite a bit of excellent POD as well.</p>

<p>The code also makes heavy use of callbacks (code references).  That is to say
its heavily event driven. Which makes sense given the event driven nature of web
servers.  For me this gave the code a JavaScript flavor.  Take for example
<code>Plack::Util::foreach</code> which works just like
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/">jQuery.each()</a> by iterating over an array
calling a code reference on each item.</p>

<pre><code>Plack::Util::foreach([1,2,3], sub { print shift }); # prints "123"
</code></pre>

<h2>Background reading</h2>

<p>The most important thing to read is the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/PSGI/PSGI.pod">PSGI spec</a>.
This is the problem Plack was built to solve.  Its clear and well
written but perhaps also a little boring and lacking in context. Still I found
it very helpful to refer back to while reading the code.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<pre><code>~/code ⚡ git clone git@github.com:plack/Plack.git
~/code ⚡ cd Plack
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing I noticed is a <code>cpanfile</code> containing a list of the project
dependencies.  Because understanding and running the tests is often useful
when reading new code I installed the dependencies using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton">Carton</a> and ran the tests.</p>

<pre><code>~/code/Plack ⚡ carton
~/code/Plack ⚡ prove -rl t
</code></pre>

<h2>Who works on Plack?</h2>

<p>Lets get a feel for who is involved in the project.</p>

<pre><code>~/code/Plack ⚡ git shortlog --summary --numbered | head

<h2>What is the lib directory structure like?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately with 71 files in the lib directory its hard to grok whats
happening in a single glance so maybe thats not a great question.  Instead I
found it helpful to group the code by functionality.  I came up
with 3 major categories which look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Category 1</em> &ndash; Modules for loading and running PSGI servers

<ul>
<li>plackup</li>
<li>Plack::Handler</li>
<li>Plack::Handler::*</li>
<li>Plack::Loader</li>
<li>Plack::Loader::*</li>
<li>Plack::Runner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Category 2</em> &ndash; Modules for building PSGI apps

<ul>
<li>Plack::App::*</li>
<li>Plack::Builder</li>
<li>Plack::Component</li>
<li>Plack::Middleware</li>
<li>Plack::Middleware::*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Category 3</em> &ndash; Modules for testing

<ul>
<li>Plack::Test</li>
<li>Plack::Test::*</li>
<li>Plack::<a href="HTTP::Message::PSGI">HTTP::Message::PSGI</a></li>
<li>Plack::LWPish</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>However I also got crazy and went ahead and listed <em>everything</em> in the lib
directory along with a brief description.  I guess it might be handy for
reference purposes.  The numbers (1), (2), (3) below correspond to the three
categories I listed above.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Look around assertions in Perl regular expressions]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/31/regex/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/31/regex</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Perl&rsquo;s regex engine evaluates a string, it moves from left to right, one
letter at a time checking the match at each position.  That position is called
the <em>current match position</em>.</p>

<p>Look around assertions allow you to match a specific pattern before or after
the current match position without moving the match position.</p>

<h1>Look ahead assertions</h1>

<p>Look ahead assertions match the text after the current match position
(without moving the match position).  They look like <code>(?=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>my $job = "space cowboy";
$job =~ /space (?=cow)/;    # matches
$job =~ /space (?=cow)cow/; # also matches
</code></pre>

<h1>Look behind assertions</h1>

<p>Look behind assertions match the text before the current match position
(without moving the match position).  They look like <code>(?&lt;=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>my $job = "space cowboy";
$job =~ /(?&lt;=space) cowboy/;      # matches
$job =~ /space(?&lt;=space) cowboy/; # also matches
</code></pre>

<h1>Positive and negative look ahead assertions</h1>

<p><em>Positive</em> look ahead assertions are look ahead assertions which match when their
subpattern matches. They look like <code>(?=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /space (?=cowboy)/;   # matches
</code></pre>

<p><em>Negative</em> look ahead assertions are look ahead assertions which match when their
subpattern fails. They look like <code>(?!pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /space (?!mooseboy)/;   # matches
</code></pre>

<h1>Positive and negative look behind assertions</h1>

<p>Positive look behind assertions are look behind assertions which match when their
subpattern matches. They look like <code>(?&lt;=pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /(?&lt;=space) cowboy/;   # matches
</code></pre>

<p>Negative look behind assertions are look behind assertions which match when
their subpattern fails. They look like <code>(?&lt;!pattern)</code>.</p>

<pre><code> my $job = "space cowboy";
 $job =~ /(?&lt;!earth) cowboy/;   # matches
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to buy.</strong>  Especially when I end up only using things
once or twice like books, dvds, dress shoes, and ties.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to store.</strong>  One time I had to rent a storage locker
because I couldn&rsquo;t take my things when I moved to China.  Some people get
big houses with walk in closets and a three car garage.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is expensive to maintain.</strong>  Broken stuff needs to be fixed.  Owning
a house means I need to fix the roof. Owning a car means I need to change
the tires.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is time consuming to maintain.</strong>  I have to dust my stuff.
A bigger house means more sweeping.
A bigger yard means more mowing. Owning a car means cleaning it and
changing the oil and scraping ice off the windows.<br/>
I need to go to the store to find replacement parts,
batteries, light bulbs, cleaning supplies, and duct tape.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff is stressful to own.</strong>  I might
lose it or dent it or scratch it or drop it or step on it.  Or it might
catch on fire.  Or someone might steal it.  Sometimes I get so stressed I buy
insurance for my stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Stuff reduces my freedom.</strong>  Its hard to move to new place because I have
to carry all my stuff with me.</li>
</ul>


<p>Therefore I have decided to live with less stuff.  So I hereby declare war on
my stuff.  And also on my things.  Here is my 4 point plan to free myself from
the tedious tyranny of too many things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Point 1:</strong> Keep a comprehensive inventory of all my stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Point 2:</strong> Ruthlessly reduce the number of things in my inventory to less than 200.</li>
<li><strong>Point 3:</strong> No new stuff unless I throw out some old stuff first.</li>
<li><strong>Point 4:</strong> Have a beer.</li>
</ul>


<p>If I were hard core I would throw out everything I didn&rsquo;t use in the last 6
months.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll be hard core at some point in the future.</p>

    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/21/cc-processors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am learning about online credit card processing.
<a href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/18/cc-processors/">Part 1</a> introduced a number of basic definitions.</p>

<p>The number of online payments is going to grow.  Only <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/credit-card-payments-growth_n_1575417.html">6% of credit card transactions are currently done online</a>.
With so much at stake, there are hundreds of payment gateways who provide a
variety of services. But I have chosen to divide them into two categories.</p>

<p>First there are <em>traditional gateways</em> who charge a monthly fee (in addition to
a variety of other fees) and often you need to obtain a merchant account on
your own which also has various fees associated with it.</p>

<p>The second category contains newer <em>full stack gateways</em> who are more user
friendly and provide a merchant account and a much simpler fee structure which
is generally a percentage charge on a per transaction basis with no monthly
fees.</p>

<p>These &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; gateways are convenient and easy but they can cost more.
They generally charge 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.  Compare that to a
more traditional gateway such as <a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a> who
charges $20 per month and $0.10 per transaction.  However you also have to
factor in the cost of a merchant account.  And both the gateway and merchant&rsquo;s
bank often charge a variety of fees which makes it difficult to assess the true
cost.</p>

<p>If you are doing a large number of transactions, saving small amounts of money
is going to make a big difference.  If you are not then it may be cheaper to
use a full stack processor and save yourself the dev work and accounting
effort.</p>

<p>One interesting company I would like to note is
<a href="https://spreedly.com">Spreedly</a>.  Spreedly provides an api layer on top many
other payment gateways so you can swap out gateways whenever you feel like it.
Their service works with a large number of payment gateways &mdash; currently 60
gateways in 73 countries.  They also give you the ability to deposit funds in
different merchant accounts based on location or other business logic.  They do
have a monthly fee structure and clearly you would only choose this solution if
you are processing a large number of transactions.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/19/use-strict/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/19/use-strict</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I always <code>use strict</code> in all my code.  But what does that actually mean?</p>

<h1>Enables strict refs</h1>

<p>Strict refs generates runtime errors when you use symbolic references.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'refs';
$ref = "yarrr matey";
print $$ref;        # runtime error but without strict refs this is ok
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict vars</h1>

<p>Strict vars generates a compile time error if you access a variable that was
not declared or is not fully qualified.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'vars';
$X::foo = 1;         # ok because its fully qualified
my $foo = 10;        # ok because my() was used.
$baz = 9;            # compile time error because $baz not declared before
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict subs</h1>

<p>Strict subs generates a compile time error if you use a bareword identifier
that&rsquo;s not a subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>no strict 'subs';
my $a = boop;
print $a; 
sub boop { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;boop&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf;      # &lt;--- compile time error here
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above generates a compile time error on line 2.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf(); 
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo; which is probably the desired output.</p>

    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/18/cc-processors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to understand credit card processing.  So I will probably write a few
articles about it.  This article has some fundamental definitions.</p>

<h2>acquiring bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquiring_bank">acquiring bank</a> is a bank
which processes card payments on behalf of a merchant.  The term &lsquo;acquirer&rsquo;
indicates the bank accepts (or acquires) credit card payments from card
issuing banks within a credit card association.  Acquirers take all the risk
and bear the burdern of most of the regulation.  Examples of acquirers are
Bank of America, FirstData, and Chase.</p>

<h2>credit card association</h2>

<p>Examples of credit card associations include Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
American Express, etc.</p>

<h2>issuing bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issuing_bank">issuing bank</a> is a bank which
provides credit cards to consumers.  The term &lsquo;issue&rsquo; indicates the bank issues
payments to the acquiring bank on behalf of the consumer.  The top issuers in
the US are American Express and Chase.</p>

<h2>payment processor</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://storecoach.com/blog/whats-difference-between-payment-processor-gateway/">payment processor</a>
is a company which peforms the actual funds transfer.  Its the technical
underpinning of a transaction.  Processors do authorization, funds transfer,
statements, calculate the interchange fee, and handle dispute management.
Processors take no risk on a transaction.  Examples of companies who are
processors are FirstData, Chase, and RBS WorldPay.</p>

<h2>gateway</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway">payment gateway</a> is a service
which ties all the various groups together and provides a nice simple interface for
the merchant to build a shopping cart or marketplace without needing to
understand all the gory details.  The gateway authorizes credit card payments
by facillitating the transfer of information between a merchant&rsquo;s bank (the
acquiring bank) and a customer&rsquo;s bank (the issuing bank).</p>

<h2>merchant account</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account">merchant account</a> is a type
of bank account provided by an acquiring bank which allows merchants to accept
payments via credit card.</p>

<h2>interchange fee</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_fee">interchange fee</a> is
the fee paid to the issuing bank by the acquiring bank.  The amount varies by
card type, card brand, transaction amount, and other factors and is set by the
card associations like Visa, Mastercard, or Discover.</p>

<h2>discount rate</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://merchantwarehouse.com/understanding-merchant-account-discount-rates">discount rate</a>
is made up of several different fees which are charged to the merchant.  This
usually includes the interchange fee.  The discount rate is a fixed
percentage-based fee charged for each transaction.  A portion of the fee is
passed to the acquiring bank who likely passes a portion to the issuing bank
who in turn passes a portion to the credit card association.</p>

<p>Rates are influenced by many things including the level of risk. Brick and
mortar stores where a card is physically present are considered the lowest
risk.  There are three categories of transaction types based on risk and each
have a different discount rate: qualified, mid-qualified and non-qualified.
Internet transactions are non-qualified which is the most expensive category.</p>

<h2>basis point</h2>

<p>1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account#Terms_to_know">basis point</a>
is 1%.  A term sometimes used when discussing the discount rate.</p>

<h2>Average Ticket Size (AVT)</h2>

<p>The might make more sense to outsiders if they had called it Average
Transaction Size.  Its the total monthly sales amount divided by the total
number of transactions for that month.  Merchant account rates and fees are
often based on a merchant&rsquo;s monthly AVT.</p>

<h2>PCI DSS</h2>

<p>PCI stands for Payment Card Industry.  DSS stands for Data Security Standard.
It is a set of security standards for organizations who handle cardholder
information.  It is defined by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)
which was formed in 2006 by the major card associations.  Note that there is a
difference between being compliant being validated as compliant.  Validation is
done annually by a Qualified Security Accessor (QSA) who creates a Report on
Compliance (ROC) for organizations handle lots of transactions or a
Self-Assessment Questionaire (SAQ) for companies handling less transactions.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/17/our-my-local/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/17/our-my-local</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>The short version for the impatient</h1>

<ul>
<li> <code>my()</code> creates a local variable</li>
<li> <code>our()</code> creates a package variable</li>
<li> <code>local()</code> temporarily changes the local value of a global variable</li>
<li> The above is mostly true.</li>
</ul>


<h1>The long version for the irrepressibly quixotic</h1>

<h2>my()</h2>

<p><code>my</code> declares the listed variable to be local to the enclosing block, file,
or <code>eval</code>.  That is to say its <em>scope</em> is local.  This kind of variable is
known as a <em>lexical variable</em>.  Note that lexical variables are hidden from
subroutines which are called from within the enclosing block.  This is known as
<em>lexical scoping</em>.</p>

<h2>our()</h2>

<p><code>our</code> creates an alias to a <em>package variable</em>.  The alias is local to the
enclosing block, file, or <code>eval</code>.  That is to say the alias is lexically scoped
just like any lexical variable.  However a package variable belongs to a
package.  It can be accessed from anywhere if you use its fully qualified name.
Here are two examples of fully qualified package variables:</p>

<pre><code>$main::a
%MyPackage::boop
</code></pre>

<p>Note that package variables are also global variables.</p>

<h2>local()</h2>

<p><code>local</code> gives temporary values to global variables.  It does not create a local
variable.  It is most commonly used when you want to locally modify a global
variable such as one of the punctuation variables.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>{ 
    local $| = 1; # enable autoflush for STDOUT
    say "hi mom";
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>local</code> modifies the listed variable to be local to the enclosing block,
file, or <code>eval</code> &mdash; AND to any subroutine called from within that block.  This
is known as <em>dynamic scoping</em>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;m writing about something I noticed while doing interviews recently.</p>

<p>If I disagree with a decision a company made, I need to jump into that with
both feet.  There is sometimes an instinct to say &ldquo;I suppose I can live with
that&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know enough about why this choice was made to complain about
it&rdquo;.  But the goal is not to complain or to highlight their ignorance or to
have an argument.</p>

<p>Disagreeing starts a discussion.  This creates an opportunity to do 2 things.</p>

<p>First, it allows me to show case what I know.  The fact I have an opinion shows
I have worked on this problem before and over the course of the discussion I
will be able to demonstrate I understand the pros and cons of the different
options and have expertise there.</p>

<p>Second, I will come to understand why the company got into the position they
are in.  Usually there is a good reason.  If it was made through ignorance I
will find out if are they open to fixing the problem &mdash; subject to priorities
of course.  I may also learn if they are interested in my opinion or are
looking for a soldier who follows orders.</p>

    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/03/14/interview-questions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently relocated from London to the Chicago area so I have been doing
interviews.  When I interview a potential client or employer I carry this list of
questions with me.  Most of the questions I have taken from other sources
online.  I have listed them in roughly the order I ask them.</p>

<h1>Understanding the job</h1>

<ul>
<li>What will I be doing every day (precisely)?</li>
<li>Why are you hiring? New product? Scaling? Someone quit?</li>
<li>Who will I report to?</li>
<li>Who will I be working with?  How big are the teams?</li>
<li>What are my boss&#8217; goals for the next 6 months/year?</li>
<li>What is the key metric for the company? For my group? For my boss?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Understanding the culture</h1>

<ul>
<li>How do you build software?  Where do requirements and features come from?
Is it a very formal process or is there no process?</li>
<li>What problems does the group have that need to be solved?</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to fix legacy code and problems that exist?</li>
<li>What do you wish you had known before starting work here?</li>
<li>Whats the worst part of this job and whats the coolest thing you have built here, personally?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Tools and best practices</h1>

<ul>
<li>What tools are being used?

<ul>
<li>bug tracking</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>which version of Perl</li>
<li>what operating system</li>
<li>why were those choices made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to use the latest stuff from CPAN?</li>
<li>Are there tests?</li>
<li>Are there automated tests?</li>
<li>What is deployment like?</li>
<li>Is Moose used? OO?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is there any allowance for remote work?</li>
<li>Are there core business hours?</li>
<li>Will I be oncall?</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/02/28/duckduckgo/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/02/28/duckduckgo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instant answers are those little boxes at the top of the DuckDuckGo search
results page.  I made one for discovering international calling codes &mdash; or
dialing codes if you prefer.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.kablamo.org/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-singapore.png" width="700" height="424">
<img src="http://blog.kablamo.org/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-down-under.png" width="700" height="424"></p>

<p>If you want to hack on DuckDuckGo and add your own instant answer its pretty
simple to <a href="http://duckduckhack.com">get started</a>.  You can use Vagrant and
VirtualBox to get a complete working dev environment.  But if you are already
running Ubuntu or OSX the following recipe is easier:</p>

<pre><code>curl http://duckpan.org/install.pl | perl 
cpanm App::DuckPAN
duckpan installdeps # installs dependencies from DuckPAN (not CPAN) to locallib
</code></pre>

<p>Next fork the repository you want to hack on.  To choose the correct repository
think about what kind of data source you are using to generate your instant answer.</p>

<ul>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice">spice repo</a>
 if you have a real time data source like a JSON web API.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodie">goodie repo</a>
 if you generate your instant answer with code and need no network access.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">fathead repo</a>
 if your data source can be placed in a key/value store.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">longtail repo</a>
 if your data source requires a full text search.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now you can start hacking.  I&rsquo;ll show you how the capitalization instant answer
from the goodie repo works.  Below is the code.  I added comments to explain
things a bit.</p>

<pre><code>package DDG::Goodie::Capitalize;
use DDG::Goodie;

# If a DuckDuckGo search query contains any of these words at the start or
# end of the query, the 'remainder' handler below will run.
triggers startend =&gt; 'capitalize', 'uppercase', 'upper case';

# This block of code is pretty much meta data describing this instant
# answer.  Mostly it is used by https://duckduckgo.com/goodies.
zci answer_type =&gt; "capitalize";
primary_example_queries 'capitalize this';
secondary_example_queries 'uppercase that';
description 'capitalize a string';
name 'Capitalize';
code_url 'https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/Capitalize.pm';
category 'conversions';
topics 'programming';
attribution twitter =&gt; 'crazedpsyc',
            cpan    =&gt; 'CRZEDPSYC' ;

# This is is where the magic happens.  $_ contains the query minus the
# trigger word.  The return value from this sub shows up on the DuckDuckGo
# search results page as an instant answer.
handle remainder =&gt; sub { uc ($_) };
</code></pre>

<p>To test your new instant answer you can launch a little web server with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>duckpan server
</code></pre>

<p>Then open your favorite web browser and surf to
<a href="http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs">http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs</a> and you should
see something like this:</p>

    <updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/01/01/readline-cheat-sheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently Ovid pointed out <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/01/ditching-a-language.html">large projects are much more likely to fail</a>.
I have a few large goals I&rsquo;d like to accomplish.  For example I want to improve
my front end design skills.  Rather than trying to tackle this problem all
at once, I made up a small project for myself.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="http://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html">Readline cheat sheet</a> and
I was able to complete this project in about a day.  Here are some
of the things I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> &ndash; I always worry libraries and frameworks like
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> are overkill and bloat since I only need
a tiny portion of their features.  But its undeniable that I was able to quickly
build a responsive mobile friendly website without needing to worry about the
technical details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Readline commands</strong> &ndash; If I had to pick one keyboad shortcut to recommend it
would be <code>Ctrl-r</code> which allows you to search backwards through your
history.  I also like the incremental undo command: <code>Ctrl-_</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Text::Xslate</strong> &ndash; People keep mentioning
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate">Text::Xslate</a> so I wanted to give it a try.
The docs say its full featured and very fast.  I liked that HTML metacharacters
are escaped by default to avoid cross site scripting attacks.  Also it supports
Template Toolkit syntax.  I didn&rsquo;t find any new killer features, but it was a
pleasure to work with.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Some new <a href="http://helabs.com.br/blog/2014/01/21/prevent-common-problems-when-writing-css-from-scratch/">CSS tricks</a></strong> &ndash;
The best trick I learned is how to keep my footer at the bottom of the page
even when it has only a few lines of content.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I was able to practice design, layout, color, and font selection.  And who
knows &mdash; perhaps this project will also drive a tiny bit of traffic to my
github profile and increase my
<a href="http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">luck surface area</a>.</p>

<p>The momentum feels good.  I need to remember to keep my projects small more often.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2014/01/01/no-dessert-forever</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years I have been hearing people say sugar is the new bad thing.  So I
finally got around to reading up on this claim.  Here is what I learned.</p>

<h1>Nutrition</h1>

<p>Food is composed of <strong>carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water, vitamins,</strong> and
<strong>minerals</strong>.  Of course, I sometimes swallow stuff that is not on that list
but the list is comprehensive in the sense that it covers everything my body
needs.  Notice that sugar is not in the list.  My body breaks down carbs and
fats into glucose (sugar) which can be used by my body as energy.</p>

<p>This means sugar has <em>zero</em> nutritional value.  There is no reason to ever
eat any.  Humans do not require sugar.</p>

<p>I have always been smug about the fact that I don&rsquo;t throw away my money on a
caffeine addiction.  But suddenly I realize I have been foolishly spending my
money on sugar.</p>

<h1>No dessert forever</h1>

<p>As part of my long term plan to someday somehow acquire a svelte physique, I
hereby <strong>reject and repudiate</strong> the harmful cultural ritual known as dessert.
The rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>No dessert forever.  No ice cream, no cake, no pie.</li>
<li>No candy forever.  No free candy or chocolate from the nice people at the office.</li>
<li>No fruit juice forever.</li>
<li>Exceptions

<ul>
<li>85%+ dark chocolate</li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Small quantities of desserts that I have never had before.</li>
</ul>
</li>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/12/18/authen-passphrase/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/12/18/authen-passphrase</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To explain how salt and pepper work in encryption, I will walk through a few
scenarios.</p>

<h1>No salt</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using no salt means an attacker doesn&rsquo;t need
to generate a rainbow table because they can reuse an existing one.</em></p>

<p>If an attacker obtains my database of encrypted passwords it will be very time
consuming to brute force them.  However there exist pre-computed tables of
encrypted values of thousands of commonly used passwords.  These tables are called
rainbow tables.  It is computationally inexpensive to match the encrypted
values in a rainbow table with the encrypted values in my database.</p>

<h1>One salt</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using the same salt for all your passwords
means an attacker must generate 1 rainbow table.</em></p>

<p>Salt is data used as an additional input to the algorthim that encrypts a
password.  If I use a salt when I encrypt a password the resulting output will
be different from someone who did not use the same salt.  That means my
attacker cannot reuse an existing rainbow table.  They must generate a new one
using the same salt I used.</p>

<p>Note that salt is usually stored as plain text in the database with the
encrypted passwords.  So the attacker usually has access to the salt.  Even so,
I have successfully made the attack more expensive.</p>

<h1>A random salt per password</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using a random salt for each password means an
attacker must generate 1 rainbow table per password.</em></p>

<p>Instead of using a single salt for the entire database I can use a different
(random) salt for each user&rsquo;s password.  This means the attacker must generate
a set of rainbow tables for each password which is even more expensive.</p>

<p>Note that I also need to store the salt for each password I have generated.
This is a pain to do manually.  Happily some clever person came up with RFC
2307 which suggests a much simpler solution.</p>

<p>Instead of storing the just the encrypted password in the password column, store
a string which concatenates the salt and the encrypted password.  This may not
sound easier.  It implies the need to parse and concatenate strings.  However
this is handled for me by the encryption libraries so its 100% pain free.  Lets
see an example.</p>

<p>To encrypt the plaintext string &lsquo;pie&rsquo; use the following Perl code</p>

<pre><code>my $blowfish = Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt-&gt;new(
   passphrase  =&gt; 'pie',
   salt_random =&gt; 1,
   cost        =&gt; 16,
);

say $blowfish-&gt;as_rfc2307; 
# the output will look like this:
# {CRYPT}$2a$14$sS80d1JlF3oR6Q4UHT.9w.DIXnV0/dLQMoVBsOp2gMRT65bWvP0P2
</code></pre>

<p>That crazy <em>{CRYPT}$2a$blarblar</em> mumbo jumbo is what we will save to the db in the password
column.  However if I know what to look for, I can see the mumbo jumbo is actually
several things smushed together:</p>

<pre><code>{CRYPT} $ 2a $ 16 $ sS80d1JlF3oR6Q4UHT.9w.DIXnV0/dLQMoVBsOp2gMRT65bWvP0P2
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>{CRYPT}</strong> &ndash; This is the scheme identifier.  It indicates which scheme is being used
so I know how to parse the rest of the string.</li>
<li><strong>$</strong> &ndash; These are field separators</li>
<li><strong>2a</strong> &ndash; A version number for this scheme</li>
<li><strong>16</strong> &ndash; The cost</li>
<li>Then there is the <strong>salt</strong> (22 base 64 digits &mdash; plain text)</li>
<li>Followed by the <strong>encrypted password</strong> (31 base 64 digits)</li>
</ul>


<p>To check if a user has submitted a valid <code>$password</code>  use the following code</p>

<pre><code>my $secret   = ''{CRYPT}$2a$16$sS80d1JlF3oR6Q4UHT.9w.DIXnV0/dLQMoVBsOp2gMRT65bWvP0P2';
my $blowfish = Authen::Passphrase-&gt;from_rfc2307($secret);

if ($blowfish-&gt;match($password)) {
    say "You may enter";
}
else {
    say "You did not say the magic word";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course we want to build this into our ORM so the Authen::Passphrase objects
are inflated and deflated for us.  Here is what that looks like in a DBIx
Result class:</p>

<pre><code>__PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/FilterColumn/);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;filter_column( password =&gt; {
    filter_to_storage   =&gt; sub { $_[1]-&gt;as_rfc2307() },                      # deflate
    filter_from_storage =&gt; sub { Authen::Passphrase-&gt;from_rfc2307($_[1]) },  # inflate
});
</code></pre>

<p>But I only showed you that so you would understand what
DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::Authen::Passphrase does under the covers.  I use
that because it makes my code simpler:</p>

<pre><code>__PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/InflateColumn::Authen::Passphrase/);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;add_columns(
    ...,
    password =&gt; {
        data_type          =&gt; 'text',
        inflate_passphrase =&gt; 'rfc2307',
    },
    ...,
);
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I encrypt passwords on <a href="https://networthify.com">networthify.com</a>
and <a href="http://iijo.org">iijo.org</a>.</p>

<h1>Adding pepper</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using pepper means an attacker must generate
many rainbow tables per password. But few people use pepper and its
controversial.</em></p>

<p>Pepper is the same as salt except that I don&rsquo;t save the value anywhere.  Lets
say I choose an 8 bit value for my pepper.  That means there are 256
possible values.  If I don&rsquo;t save that value anywhere then when a user logs
in I will need to try up to 256 values to see if the user has the right
password.  However it means my attacker will need to generate up to 256
rainbow tables for each password.</p>

<p>One big problem is that trying 256 possible values is going to take me about 4
minutes on average hardware.</p>

<p>Even if I ignore that issue, this option is controversial and my understanding
is that few people do it.  It is generally accepted that messing about with
salt and pepper should be left to the professionals who are writing the
encryption libraries.  Pepper is not supported by Authen::Passphrase.</p>

<h1>Caveats</h1>

<p>Salting is done to make rainbow tables inneffective.  For various reasons
crackers rarely use rainbow tables anymore.  Instead they use sophisticated
brute force algorithms which combine dictionary attacks with databases of known
or commonly used passwords.  These kinds of brute force attacks can often crack
battery-horse-staple <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD</a> style passwords even if they
are very long.  Password are not secure unless they are very long <em>and</em>
very random.</p>

<p>And there is more bad news.  While salting makes it harder to crack all the
passwords in the database, cracking a single targeted password is often not
computationally hard.  A single completely random 8 character password can be
cracked with brute force in 10 days.</p>

<p>The only way to protect your users is to require very long and very random
passwords.  Make sure your website requires a minimum password length of 8
characters or more.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/12/15/dalios-principles/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.kablamo.org/2013/12/15/dalios-principles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been reading Ray Dalio&rsquo;s <em>Principles</em>.  Ray Dalio is the CEO of
Bridgewater which is a big famous successful hedge fund he started in the 70&rsquo;s.
<em>Principles</em>, is a 123 page philosophical text he published in 2011 about how
to live your life and how to manage people and organizations.  Its extremely
good.  I&rsquo;m not done yet but I have a feeling it is something I&rsquo;m going to be
rereading many times over the next few years.  You can download it from the
<a href="http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf">Bridewater website</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a sample:</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people react to pain badly. They have “fight or flight” reactions to it:
they either strike out at whatever brought them the pain or they try to run
away from it. As a result, they don’t learn to find ways around their barriers,
so they encounter them over and over again and make little or no progress
toward what they want&hellip;</p>

<p>Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel the pain if you approach it correctly,
because it will signal that you need to find solutions and to progress. Since
the only way you are going to find solutions to painful problems is by thinking
deeply about them &ndash; i.e., reflecting &ndash; if you can develop a knee-jerk reaction
to pain that is to reflect rather than to fight or flee, it will lead to your
rapid learning/evolving.</p></blockquote>

<p>And from that he derives this equation:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pain + Reflection = Progress</p></blockquote>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve been trying to do this.  Whenever I experience conflict, stress, anger,
or pain, I will try to make that into an opportunity to evolve and to become
stronger.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of <em>Principles</em> feels like common sense.  But at the same time I
can see that some of that common sense stuff is stuff I haven&rsquo;t been doing or
have been doing half way or just have not thought through as much as Dalio has.
I think that having this set of considered formalized principles to refer
to will help me to get what I want from life.</p>

<p>By the way, I discovered <em>Principles</em> via
<a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/">Sebastian Marshall</a>.  Sebastion is an American
who has been living and working in Japan for about 10 years.  His writing is
always interesting and is a great source of new ideas for me.</p>

git log --diff-filter=D --author=Batman --summary  # all files deleted by Batman
</code></pre>

<p>How to restore a deleted file:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;~1 &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To make this process a little easier next time I need to do it, I created a git
alias for finding deleted files by adding this to my .gitconfig file:</p>

<pre><code>[aliases]
deleted = log --diff-filter=D --summary
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can find and restore files like this:</p>

<pre><code>git deleted                         # find a deleted file and its commit
git checkout &lt;commit&gt;~1 &lt;filename&gt;  # restore the deleted file
</code></pre>

<h2>How to search the contents of deleted files</h2>

<p>But lets say I don&rsquo;t remember the filename of that file I deleted in a fit of
cleanup passion.  I do remember the name of one of the functions in it though.
Here is how to deal with that.  Search the contents of all files that have ever
existed in git for a string:</p>

<pre><code>git log --summary -S&lt;string&gt; [&lt;path/to/file&gt;] [--since=2009.1.1] [--until=2010.1.1]
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>git rev-list --all | xargs git grep 'string'
</code></pre>

<p>Git is all knowing and all seeing and all powerful.  Hail git, powerful arcane
lord of source control.</p>

your <code>~/.tmux.conf</code> file:</p>

<p>Notice thats a capital <code>R</code> not a lowercase <code>r</code>.  I keep forgetting that.</p>
