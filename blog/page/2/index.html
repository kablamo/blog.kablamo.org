  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently relocated from London to the Chicago area so I have been doing
interviews.  When I interview a potential client or employer I carry this list of
questions with me.  Most of the questions I have taken from other sources
online.  I have listed them in roughly the order I ask them.</p>

<h1>Understanding the job</h1>

<ul>
<li>What will I be doing every day (precisely)?</li>
<li>Why are you hiring? New product? Scaling? Someone quit?</li>
<li>Who will I report to?</li>
<li>Who will I be working with?  How big are the teams?</li>
<li>What are my boss&#8217; goals for the next 6 months/year?</li>
<li>What is the key metric for the company? For my group? For my boss?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Understanding the culture</h1>

<ul>
<li>How do you build software?  Where do requirements and features come from?
Is it a very formal process or is there no process?</li>
<li>What problems does the group have that need to be solved?</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to fix legacy code and problems that exist?</li>
<li>What do you wish you had known before starting work here?</li>
<li>Whats the worst part of this job and whats the coolest thing you have built here, personally?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Tools and best practices</h1>

<ul>
<li>What tools are being used?

<ul>
<li>bug tracking</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>which version of Perl</li>
<li>what operating system</li>
<li>why were those choices made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to use the latest stuff from CPAN?</li>
<li>Are there tests?</li>
<li>Are there automated tests?</li>
<li>What is deployment like?</li>
<li>Is Moose used? OO?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is there any allowance for remote work?</li>
<li>Are there core business hours?</li>
<li>Will I be oncall?</li>
</ul>

      <p class="meta">
        








  



<time datetime="2014-02-28T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 28<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Instant answers are those little boxes at the top of the DuckDuckGo search
results page.  I made one for discovering international calling codes &mdash; or
dialing codes if you prefer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-singapore.png" width="700" height="424">
<img src="/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-down-under.png" width="700" height="424"></p>

<p>If you want to hack on DuckDuckGo and add your own instant answer its pretty
simple to <a href="http://duckduckhack.com">get started</a>.  You can use Vagrant and
VirtualBox to get a complete working dev environment.  But if you are already
running Ubuntu or OSX the following recipe is easier:</p>

<pre><code>curl http://duckpan.org/install.pl | perl 
cpanm App::DuckPAN
duckpan installdeps # installs dependencies from DuckPAN (not CPAN) to locallib
</code></pre>

<p>Next fork the repository you want to hack on.  To choose the correct repository
think about what kind of data source you are using to generate your instant answer.</p>

<ul>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice">spice repo</a>
 if you have a real time data source like a JSON web API.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodie">goodie repo</a>
 if you generate your instant answer with code and need no network access.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">fathead repo</a>
 if your data source can be placed in a key/value store.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">longtail repo</a>
 if your data source requires a full text search.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now you can start hacking.  I&rsquo;ll show you how the capitalization instant answer
from the goodie repo works.  Below is the code.  I added comments to explain
things a bit.</p>

<pre><code>package DDG::Goodie::Capitalize;
use DDG::Goodie;

# If a DuckDuckGo search query contains any of these words at the start or
# end of the query, the 'remainder' handler below will run.
triggers startend =&gt; 'capitalize', 'uppercase', 'upper case';

# This block of code is pretty much meta data describing this instant
# answer.  Mostly it is used by https://duckduckgo.com/goodies.
zci answer_type =&gt; "capitalize";
primary_example_queries 'capitalize this';
secondary_example_queries 'uppercase that';
description 'capitalize a string';
name 'Capitalize';
code_url 'https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/Capitalize.pm';
category 'conversions';
topics 'programming';
attribution twitter =&gt; 'crazedpsyc',
            cpan    =&gt; 'CRZEDPSYC' ;

# This is is where the magic happens.  $_ contains the query minus the
# trigger word.  The return value from this sub shows up on the DuckDuckGo
# search results page as an instant answer.
handle remainder =&gt; sub { uc ($_) };
</code></pre>

<p>To test your new instant answer you can launch a little web server with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>duckpan server
</code></pre>

<p>Then open your favorite web browser and surf to
<a href="http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs">http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs</a> and you should
see something like this:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently Ovid pointed out <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/01/ditching-a-language.html">large projects are much more likely to fail</a>.
I have a few large goals I&rsquo;d like to accomplish.  For example I want to improve
my front end design skills.  Rather than trying to tackle this problem all
at once, I made up a small project for myself.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="http://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html">Readline cheat sheet</a> and
I was able to complete this project in about a day.  Here are some
of the things I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> &ndash; I always worry libraries and frameworks like
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> are overkill and bloat since I only need
a tiny portion of their features.  But its undeniable that I was able to quickly
build a responsive mobile friendly website without needing to worry about the
technical details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Readline commands</strong> &ndash; If I had to pick one keyboad shortcut to recommend it
would be <code>Ctrl-r</code> which allows you to search backwards through your
history.  I also like the incremental undo command: <code>Ctrl-_</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Text::Xslate</strong> &ndash; People keep mentioning
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate">Text::Xslate</a> so I wanted to give it a try.
The docs say its full featured and very fast.  I liked that HTML metacharacters
are escaped by default to avoid cross site scripting attacks.  Also it supports
Template Toolkit syntax.  I didn&rsquo;t find any new killer features, but it was a
pleasure to work with.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Some new <a href="http://helabs.com.br/blog/2014/01/21/prevent-common-problems-when-writing-css-from-scratch/">CSS tricks</a></strong> &ndash;
The best trick I learned is how to keep my footer at the bottom of the page
even when it has only a few lines of content.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I was able to practice design, layout, color, and font selection.  And who
knows &mdash; perhaps this project will also drive a tiny bit of traffic to my
github profile and increase my
<a href="http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">luck surface area</a>.</p>

<p>The momentum feels good.  I need to remember to keep my projects small more often.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For years I have been hearing people say sugar is the new bad thing.  So I
finally got around to reading up on this claim.  Here is what I learned.</p>

<h1>Nutrition</h1>

<p>Food is composed of <strong>carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water, vitamins,</strong> and
<strong>minerals</strong>.  Of course, I sometimes swallow stuff that is not on that list
but the list is comprehensive in the sense that it covers everything my body
needs.  Notice that sugar is not in the list.  My body breaks down carbs and
fats into glucose (sugar) which can be used by my body as energy.</p>

<p>This means sugar has <em>zero</em> nutritional value.  There is no reason to ever
eat any.  Humans do not require sugar.</p>

<p>I have always been smug about the fact that I don&rsquo;t throw away my money on a
caffeine addiction.  But suddenly I realize I have been foolishly spending my
money on sugar.</p>

<h1>No dessert forever</h1>

<p>As part of my long term plan to someday somehow acquire a svelte physique, I
hereby <strong>reject and repudiate</strong> the harmful cultural ritual known as dessert.
The rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>No dessert forever.  No ice cream, no cake, no pie.</li>
<li>No candy forever.  No free candy or chocolate from the nice people at the office.</li>
<li>No fruit juice forever.</li>
<li>Exceptions

<ul>
<li>85%+ dark chocolate</li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Small quantities of desserts that I have never had before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To explain how salt and pepper work in encryption, I will walk through a few
scenarios.</p>

<h1>No salt</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using no salt means an attacker doesn&rsquo;t need
to generate a rainbow table because they can reuse an existing one.</em></p>

<p>If an attacker obtains my database of encrypted passwords it will be very time
consuming to brute force them.  However there exist pre-computed tables of
encrypted values of thousands of commonly used passwords.  These tables are called
rainbow tables.  It is computationally inexpensive to match the encrypted
values in a rainbow table with the encrypted values in my database.</p>

<h1>One salt</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using the same salt for all your passwords
means an attacker must generate 1 rainbow table.</em></p>

<p>Salt is data used as an additional input to the algorthim that encrypts a
password.  If I use a salt when I encrypt a password the resulting output will
be different from someone who did not use the same salt.  That means my
attacker cannot reuse an existing rainbow table.  They must generate a new one
using the same salt I used.</p>

<p>Note that salt is usually stored as plain text in the database with the
encrypted passwords.  So the attacker usually has access to the salt.  Even so,
I have successfully made the attack more expensive.</p>

<h1>A random salt per password</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using a random salt for each password means an
attacker must generate 1 rainbow table per password.</em></p>

<p>Instead of using a single salt for the entire database I can use a different
(random) salt for each user&rsquo;s password.  This means the attacker must generate
a set of rainbow tables for each password which is even more expensive.</p>

<p>Note that I also need to store the salt for each password I have generated.
This is a pain to do manually.  Happily some clever person came up with RFC
2307 which suggests a much simpler solution.</p>

<p>Instead of storing the just the encrypted password in the password column, store
a string which concatenates the salt and the encrypted password.  This may not
sound easier.  It implies the need to parse and concatenate strings.  However
this is handled for me by the encryption libraries so its 100% pain free.  Lets
see an example.</p>

<p>To encrypt the plaintext string &lsquo;pie&rsquo; use the following Perl code</p>

<pre><code>my $blowfish = Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt-&gt;new(
   passphrase  =&gt; 'pie',
   salt_random =&gt; 1,
   cost        =&gt; 16,
);

say $blowfish-&gt;as_rfc2307; 
# the output will look like this:
# {CRYPT}$2a$14$sS80d1JlF3oR6Q4UHT.9w.DIXnV0/dLQMoVBsOp2gMRT65bWvP0P2
</code></pre>

<p>That crazy <em>{CRYPT}$2a$blarblar</em> mumbo jumbo is what we will save to the db in the password
column.  However if I know what to look for, I can see the mumbo jumbo is actually
several things smushed together:</p>

<pre><code>{CRYPT} $ 2a $ 16 $ sS80d1JlF3oR6Q4UHT.9w.DIXnV0/dLQMoVBsOp2gMRT65bWvP0P2
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>{CRYPT}</strong> &ndash; This is the scheme identifier.  It indicates which scheme is being used
so I know how to parse the rest of the string.</li>
<li><strong>$</strong> &ndash; These are field separators</li>
<li><strong>2a</strong> &ndash; A version number for this scheme</li>
<li><strong>16</strong> &ndash; The cost</li>
<li>Then there is the <strong>salt</strong> (22 base 64 digits &mdash; plain text)</li>
<li>Followed by the <strong>encrypted password</strong> (31 base 64 digits)</li>
</ul>


<p>To check if a user has submitted a valid <code>$password</code>  use the following code</p>

<pre><code>my $secret   = ''{CRYPT}$2a$16$sS80d1JlF3oR6Q4UHT.9w.DIXnV0/dLQMoVBsOp2gMRT65bWvP0P2';
my $blowfish = Authen::Passphrase-&gt;from_rfc2307($secret);

if ($blowfish-&gt;match($password)) {
    say "You may enter";
}
else {
    say "You did not say the magic word";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course we want to build this into our ORM so the Authen::Passphrase objects
are inflated and deflated for us.  Here is what that looks like in a DBIx
Result class:</p>

<pre><code>__PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/FilterColumn/);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;filter_column( password =&gt; {
    filter_to_storage   =&gt; sub { $_[1]-&gt;as_rfc2307() },                      # deflate
    filter_from_storage =&gt; sub { Authen::Passphrase-&gt;from_rfc2307($_[1]) },  # inflate
});
</code></pre>

<p>But I only showed you that so you would understand what
DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::Authen::Passphrase does under the covers.  I use
that because it makes my code simpler:</p>

<pre><code>__PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/InflateColumn::Authen::Passphrase/);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;add_columns(
    ...,
    password =&gt; {
        data_type          =&gt; 'text',
        inflate_passphrase =&gt; 'rfc2307',
    },
    ...,
);
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I encrypt passwords on <a href="https://networthify.com">networthify.com</a>
and <a href="http://iijo.org">iijo.org</a>.</p>

<h1>Adding pepper</h1>

<p><strong>Summary for the impatient:</strong>  <em>Using pepper means an attacker must generate
many rainbow tables per password. But few people use pepper and its
controversial.</em></p>

<p>Pepper is the same as salt except that I don&rsquo;t save the value anywhere.  Lets
say I choose an 8 bit value for my pepper.  That means there are 256
possible values.  If I don&rsquo;t save that value anywhere then when a user logs
in I will need to try up to 256 values to see if the user has the right
password.  However it means my attacker will need to generate up to 256
rainbow tables for each password.</p>

<p>One big problem is that trying 256 possible values is going to take me about 4
minutes on average hardware.</p>

<p>Even if I ignore that issue, this option is controversial and my understanding
is that few people do it.  It is generally accepted that messing about with
salt and pepper should be left to the professionals who are writing the
encryption libraries.  Pepper is not supported by Authen::Passphrase.</p>

<h1>Caveats</h1>

<p>Salting is done to make rainbow tables inneffective.  For various reasons
crackers rarely use rainbow tables anymore.  Instead they use sophisticated
brute force algorithms which combine dictionary attacks with databases of known
or commonly used passwords.  These kinds of brute force attacks can often crack
battery-horse-staple <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD</a> style passwords even if they
are very long.  Password are not secure unless they are very long <em>and</em>
very random.</p>

<p>And there is more bad news.  While salting makes it harder to crack all the
passwords in the database, cracking a single targeted password is often not
computationally hard.  A single completely random 8 character password can be
cracked with brute force in 10 days.</p>

<p>The only way to protect your users is to require very long and very random
passwords.  Make sure your website requires a minimum password length of 8
characters or more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been reading Ray Dalio&rsquo;s <em>Principles</em>.  Ray Dalio is the CEO of
Bridgewater which is a big famous successful hedge fund he started in the 70&rsquo;s.
<em>Principles</em>, is a 123 page philosophical text he published in 2011 about how
to live your life and how to manage people and organizations.  Its extremely
good.  I&rsquo;m not done yet but I have a feeling it is something I&rsquo;m going to be
rereading many times over the next few years.  You can download it from the
<a href="http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf">Bridewater website</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a sample:</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people react to pain badly. They have “fight or flight” reactions to it:
they either strike out at whatever brought them the pain or they try to run
away from it. As a result, they don’t learn to find ways around their barriers,
so they encounter them over and over again and make little or no progress
toward what they want&hellip;</p>

<p>Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel the pain if you approach it correctly,
because it will signal that you need to find solutions and to progress. Since
the only way you are going to find solutions to painful problems is by thinking
deeply about them &ndash; i.e., reflecting &ndash; if you can develop a knee-jerk reaction
to pain that is to reflect rather than to fight or flee, it will lead to your
rapid learning/evolving.</p></blockquote>

<p>And from that he derives this equation:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pain + Reflection = Progress</p></blockquote>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve been trying to do this.  Whenever I experience conflict, stress, anger,
or pain, I will try to make that into an opportunity to evolve and to become
stronger.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of <em>Principles</em> feels like common sense.  But at the same time I
can see that some of that common sense stuff is stuff I haven&rsquo;t been doing or
have been doing half way or just have not thought through as much as Dalio has.
I think that having this set of considered formalized principles to refer
to will help me to get what I want from life.</p>

<p>By the way, I discovered <em>Principles</em> via
<a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/">Sebastian Marshall</a>.  Sebastion is an American
who has been living and working in Japan for about 10 years.  His writing is
always interesting and is a great source of new ideas for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to delete files from your git repository.  You can get restore
them.  You can even search for a string in a deleted file.  Here is how to find
a deleted file and its commit:</p>

<pre><code>git log --diff-filter=D --summary                  # all deleted files ever
git log --diff-filter=D --summary .                # all deleted files in cwd 
git log --diff-filter=D --author=Batman --summary  # all files deleted by Batman
</code></pre>

<p>How to restore a deleted file:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;~1 &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To make this process a little easier next time I need to do it, I created a git
alias for finding deleted files by adding this to my .gitconfig file:</p>

<pre><code>[aliases]
deleted = log --diff-filter=D --summary
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can find and restore files like this:</p>

<pre><code>git deleted                         # find a deleted file and its commit
git checkout &lt;commit&gt;~1 &lt;filename&gt;  # restore the deleted file
</code></pre>

<h2>How to search the contents of deleted files</h2>

<p>But lets say I don&rsquo;t remember the filename of that file I deleted in a fit of
cleanup passion.  I do remember the name of one of the functions in it though.
Here is how to deal with that.  Search the contents of all files that have ever
existed in git for a string:</p>

<pre><code>git log --summary -S&lt;string&gt; [&lt;path/to/file&gt;] [--since=2009.1.1] [--until=2010.1.1]
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>git rev-list --all | xargs git grep 'string'
</code></pre>

<p>Git is all knowing and all seeing and all powerful.  Hail git, powerful arcane
lord of source control.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use and love OSX growl and Ubuntu notify style desktop notifications.  They
are gorgeous.  But they are also distracting and after a few vibrant and
whimsical but fleeting seconds they are gone forever and you have no way to get
them back.</p>

<p>A more useful (and less glorious) way to receive notifications is in your
<a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> status bar.  tmux is the brilliant
successor to the venerable screen which hasn&rsquo;t been actively developed for
quite a while.</p>

<p>Here is how I configure notifications in my .tmux.conf file:</p>

<pre><code>set -g status-interval 15    
set -g status-right !exec my_shell_script
</code></pre>

<p>This tells tmux to run <code>my_shell_script</code> every 15 seconds.  It displays the
first line of output from the shell script.  Now I can get unobtrusive status
updates which don&rsquo;t go away. And if I ate a good breakfast, feel rested, and
have the wind at my back I can write some code to log my notifications to a
file so that I don&rsquo;t miss any.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas that might be useful which I might someday do maybe perhaps
possibly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Status updates when someone says your name on irc</li>
<li>Status updates when jenkins tests fail</li>
<li>Status updates when people push code live</li>
<li>Status updates when people merge branches</li>
</ul>


<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Also don&rsquo;t miss the tmux <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">powerline</a>
status bar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I started breaking out of my Perl-only isolation bubble and dabbling
with other languages. I was surprised how easy and comfortable other languages
are. I think its because these days good ideas spread from one language to the
next incredibly fast. Even in a new language when I reach for a tool I can
usually find some Perl technology analogue.</p>

<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve been a perlbrew person for a long time and it has served me
well.  Ruby has its own version of perlbrew called rbenv which is pretty great.
But actually it seems every language has a clone of rbenv.</p>

<ul>
<li>Python has pyenv.</li>
<li>PHP has phpenv.</li>
<li>Node has ndenv.</li>
<li>Java has jenv.</li>
<li>Perl has plenv.</li>
</ul>


<p>So I thought, what the heck &mdash; lets try that out.  The nice thing
is all the envs have pretty much the same command line options and the same
approach to managing dependencies.  I thought it might be calming and soothing
for my brain to have one way of doing things.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/riywo/anyenv">Anyenv</a> just a second ago as I was
writing this.  It claims it will manage all my envs. Looks like brilliant
stuff. Fortune favors the bold. (I eat danger for breakfast.)  I&rsquo;ll try it.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/riywo/anyenv ~/.anyenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.anyenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.my_profile
echo 'eval "$(anyenv init -)"'               &gt;&gt; ~/.my_profile
exec bash -l
anyenv install rbenv    # ruby
anyenv install plenv    # perl
anyenv install pyenv    # python
anyenv install phpenv   # php
anyenv install ndenv    # nodejs
anyenv install denv     # dunno
anyenv install jenv     # java
exec bash -l            # &lt;-- useful trick btw
anyenv versions
</code></pre>

<p>Ok now I have all the envs.  But I want to actually do some work with plenv.
Lets see if I can do that.</p>

<pre><code>plenv install --list  # list all the potential perl versions you can use
plenv install 5.19.6  # install perl v5.19.6
plenv rehash          # reload the shell environment with the new perl
plenv global 5.19.6   # use v5.19.6 everywhere by default
plenv local  5.19.6   # use v5.19.6 in this directory for this project
plenv install-cpanm   # install cpanm for this version of perl
plenv rehash          #
plenv which cpanm     # see where cpanm is installed. should be ~/.anyenv
</code></pre>

<p>Now I will install the dependencies for my project.  I will manage them with
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton">Carton</a>.</p>

<pre><code>cpanm Carton          # install carton for this version of perl
plenv list-modules
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I need to create a <code>cpanfile</code>.  There are all kinds of cool
things you can do in this file, but with your permision I will begin with baby
steps.  Here is mine cpanfile for now:</p>

<pre><code>requires "Catalyst";
requires "Plack";
requires "DBD::SQLite";
</code></pre>

<p>And then I run carton to install these modules locally into local/lib/perl5.</p>

<pre><code>carton               # install all the dependencies from the cpanfile
ls local/lib/perl5/  # see all the new modules installed here
plenv list-modules   # see mountains of installed stuff
cd /tmp
plenv list-modules   # see nothing installed except Carton
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that a carton.snapshot file was created.  If I look inside, I can see a
list of all my project dependencies, and all their dependencies, etc all the
way down to the first turtle &mdash; AND there are version numbers for everything.</p>

<pre><code># carton snapshot format: version 1.0
DISTRIBUTIONS
Apache-LogFormat-Compiler-0.13
  pathname: K/KA/KAZEBURO/Apache-LogFormat-Compiler-0.13.tar.gz
    provides:
      Apache::LogFormat::Compiler 0.13
    requirements:
      CPAN::Meta 0
      CPAN::Meta::Prereqs 0
      Module::Build 0.38
...blah biddee blah etc...
</code></pre>

<p>I can add <code>cpanfile</code> and <code>cpanfile.snapshot</code> to my git repo.  Now when I deploy
or share the code, the user at the destination can run Carton and they will end
up with the exact dependencies with the exact same version numbers I had. This
way I can be sure my code will run as successfully for them as it did for me.</p>
