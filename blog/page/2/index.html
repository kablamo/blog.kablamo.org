  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am learning about online credit card processing.
<a href="/2014/03/18/cc-processors/">Part 1</a> introduced a number of basic definitions.</p>

<p>The number of online payments is going to grow.  Only <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/credit-card-payments-growth_n_1575417.html">6% of credit card transactions are currently done online</a>.
With so much at stake, there are hundreds of payment gateways who provide a
variety of services. But I have chosen to divide them into two categories.</p>

<p>First there are <em>traditional gateways</em> who charge a monthly fee (in addition to
a variety of other fees) and often you need to obtain a merchant account on
your own which also has various fees associated with it.</p>

<p>The second category contains newer <em>full stack gateways</em> who are more user
friendly and provide a merchant account and a much simpler fee structure which
is generally a percentage charge on a per transaction basis with no monthly
fees.</p>

<p>These &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; gateways are convenient and easy but they can cost more.
They generally charge 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.  Compare that to a
more traditional gateway such as <a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a> who
charges $20 per month and $0.10 per transaction.  However you also have to
factor in the cost of a merchant account.  And both the gateway and merchant&rsquo;s
bank often charge a variety of fees which makes it difficult to assess the true
cost.</p>

<p>If you are doing a large number of transactions, saving small amounts of money
is going to make a big difference.  If you are not then it may be cheaper to
use a full stack processor and save yourself the dev work and accounting
effort.</p>

<p>One interesting company I would like to note is
<a href="https://spreedly.com">Spreedly</a>.  Spreedly provides an api layer on top many
other payment gateways so you can swap out gateways whenever you feel like it.
Their service works with a large number of payment gateways &mdash; currently 60
gateways in 73 countries.  They also give you the ability to deposit funds in
different merchant accounts based on location or other business logic.  They do
have a monthly fee structure and clearly you would only choose this solution if
you are processing a large number of transactions.</p>

<p>Also I found this series of videos was an excellent introduction to
understanding payments at a lower level.  Be aware this is probably more than
most web developers need/want to know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always <code>use strict</code> in all my code.  But what does that actually mean?</p>

<h1>Enables strict refs</h1>

<p>Strict refs generates runtime errors when you use symbolic references.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'refs';
$ref = "yarrr matey";
print $$ref;        # runtime error but without strict refs this is ok
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict vars</h1>

<p>Strict vars generates a compile time error if you access a variable that was
not declared or is not fully qualified.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'vars';
$X::foo = 1;         # ok because its fully qualified
my $foo = 10;        # ok because my() was used.
$baz = 9;            # compile time error because $baz not declared before
</code></pre>

<h1>Enables strict subs</h1>

<p>Strict subs generates a compile time error if you use a bareword identifier
that&rsquo;s not a subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>no strict 'subs';
my $a = boop;
print $a; 
sub boop { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;boop&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf;      # &lt;--- compile time error here
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above generates a compile time error on line 2.</p>

<pre><code>use strict 'subs';
my $b = splarf(); 
sub splarf { return "dinosaurs smell good" }
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints &ldquo;dinosaurs smell good&rdquo; which is probably the desired output.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to understand credit card processing.  So I will probably write a few
articles about it.  This article has some fundamental definitions.</p>

<h2>acquiring bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquiring_bank">acquiring bank</a> is a bank
which processes card payments on behalf of a merchant.  The term &lsquo;acquirer&rsquo;
indicates the bank accepts (or acquires) credit card payments from card
issuing banks within a credit card association.  Acquirers take all the risk
and bear the burdern of most of the regulation.  Examples of acquirers are
Bank of America, FirstData, and Chase.</p>

<h2>credit card association</h2>

<p>Examples of credit card associations include Visa, MasterCard, Discover,
American Express, etc.</p>

<h2>issuing bank</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issuing_bank">issuing bank</a> is a bank which
provides credit cards to consumers.  The term &lsquo;issue&rsquo; indicates the bank issues
payments to the acquiring bank on behalf of the consumer.  The top issuers in
the US are American Express and Chase.</p>

<h2>payment processor</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://storecoach.com/blog/whats-difference-between-payment-processor-gateway/">payment processor</a>
is a company which peforms the actual funds transfer.  Its the technical
underpinning of a transaction.  Processors do authorization, funds transfer,
statements, calculate the interchange fee, and handle dispute management.
Processors take no risk on a transaction.  Examples of companies who are
processors are FirstData, Chase, and RBS WorldPay.</p>

<h2>gateway</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway">payment gateway</a> is a service
which ties all the various groups together and provides a nice simple interface for
the merchant to build a shopping cart or marketplace without needing to
understand all the gory details.  The gateway authorizes credit card payments
by facillitating the transfer of information between a merchant&rsquo;s bank (the
acquiring bank) and a customer&rsquo;s bank (the issuing bank).</p>

<h2>merchant account</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account">merchant account</a> is a type
of bank account provided by an acquiring bank which allows merchants to accept
payments via credit card.</p>

<h2>interchange fee</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_fee">interchange fee</a> is
the fee paid to the issuing bank by the acquiring bank.  The amount varies by
card type, card brand, transaction amount, and other factors and is set by the
card associations like Visa, Mastercard, or Discover.</p>

<h2>discount rate</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://merchantwarehouse.com/understanding-merchant-account-discount-rates">discount rate</a>
is made up of several different fees which are charged to the merchant.  This
usually includes the interchange fee.  The discount rate is a fixed
percentage-based fee charged for each transaction.  A portion of the fee is
passed to the acquiring bank who likely passes a portion to the issuing bank
who in turn passes a portion to the credit card association.</p>

<p>Rates are influenced by many things including the level of risk. Brick and
mortar stores where a card is physically present are considered the lowest
risk.  There are three categories of transaction types based on risk and each
have a different discount rate: qualified, mid-qualified and non-qualified.
Internet transactions are non-qualified which is the most expensive category.</p>

<h2>basis point</h2>

<p>1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account#Terms_to_know">basis point</a>
is 1%.  A term sometimes used when discussing the discount rate.</p>

<h2>Average Ticket Size (AVT)</h2>

<p>The might make more sense to outsiders if they had called it Average
Transaction Size.  Its the total monthly sales amount divided by the total
number of transactions for that month.  Merchant account rates and fees are
often based on a merchant&rsquo;s monthly AVT.</p>

<h2>PCI DSS</h2>

<p>PCI stands for Payment Card Industry.  DSS stands for Data Security Standard.
It is a set of security standards for organizations who handle cardholder
information.  It is defined by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)
which was formed in 2006 by the major card associations.  Note that there is a
difference between being compliant being validated as compliant.  Validation is
done annually by a Qualified Security Accessor (QSA) who creates a Report on
Compliance (ROC) for organizations handle lots of transactions or a
Self-Assessment Questionaire (SAQ) for companies handling less transactions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>The short version for the impatient</h1>

<ul>
<li> <code>my()</code> creates a local variable</li>
<li> <code>our()</code> creates a package variable</li>
<li> <code>local()</code> temporarily changes the local value of a global variable</li>
<li> The above is mostly true.</li>
</ul>


<h1>The long version for the irrepressibly quixotic</h1>

<h2>my()</h2>

<p><code>my</code> declares the listed variable to be local to the enclosing block, file,
or <code>eval</code>.  That is to say its <em>scope</em> is local.  This kind of variable is
known as a <em>lexical variable</em>.  Note that lexical variables are hidden from
subroutines which are called from within the enclosing block.  This is known as
<em>lexical scoping</em>.</p>

<h2>our()</h2>

<p><code>our</code> creates an alias to a <em>package variable</em>.  The alias is local to the
enclosing block, file, or <code>eval</code>.  That is to say the alias is lexically scoped
just like any lexical variable.  However a package variable belongs to a
package.  It can be accessed from anywhere if you use its fully qualified name.
Here are two examples of fully qualified package variables:</p>

<pre><code>$main::a
%MyPackage::boop
</code></pre>

<p>Note that package variables are also global variables.</p>

<h2>local()</h2>

<p><code>local</code> gives temporary values to global variables.  It does not create a local
variable.  It is most commonly used when you want to locally modify a global
variable such as one of the punctuation variables.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>{ 
    local $| = 1; # enable autoflush for STDOUT
    say "hi mom";
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>local</code> modifies the listed variable to be local to the enclosing block,
file, or <code>eval</code> &mdash; AND to any subroutine called from within that block.  This
is known as <em>dynamic scoping</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&rsquo;m writing about something I noticed while doing interviews recently.</p>

<p>If I disagree with a decision a company made, I need to jump into that with
both feet.  There is sometimes an instinct to say &ldquo;I suppose I can live with
that&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know enough about why this choice was made to complain about
it&rdquo;.  But the goal is not to complain or to highlight their ignorance or to
have an argument.</p>

<p>Disagreeing starts a discussion.  This creates an opportunity to do 2 things.</p>

<p>First, it allows me to show case what I know.  The fact I have an opinion shows
I have worked on this problem before and over the course of the discussion I
will be able to demonstrate I understand the pros and cons of the different
options and have expertise there.</p>

<p>Second, I will come to understand why the company got into the position they
are in.  Usually there is a good reason.  If it was made through ignorance I
will find out if are they open to fixing the problem &mdash; subject to priorities
of course.  I may also learn if they are interested in my opinion or are
looking for a soldier who follows orders.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently relocated from London to the Chicago area so I have been doing
interviews.  When I interview a potential client or employer I carry this list of
questions with me.  Most of the questions I have taken from other sources
online.  I have listed them in roughly the order I ask them.</p>

<h1>Understanding the job</h1>

<ul>
<li>What will I be doing every day (precisely)?</li>
<li>Why are you hiring? New product? Scaling? Someone quit?</li>
<li>Who will I report to?</li>
<li>Who will I be working with?  How big are the teams?</li>
<li>What are my boss&#8217; goals for the next 6 months/year?</li>
<li>What is the key metric for the company? For my group? For my boss?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Understanding the culture</h1>

<ul>
<li>How do you build software?  Where do requirements and features come from?
Is it a very formal process or is there no process?</li>
<li>What problems does the group have that need to be solved?</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to fix legacy code and problems that exist?</li>
<li>What do you wish you had known before starting work here?</li>
<li>Whats the worst part of this job and whats the coolest thing you have built here, personally?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Tools and best practices</h1>

<ul>
<li>What tools are being used?

<ul>
<li>bug tracking</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>which version of Perl</li>
<li>what operating system</li>
<li>why were those choices made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a mandate to use the latest stuff from CPAN?</li>
<li>Are there tests?</li>
<li>Are there automated tests?</li>
<li>What is deployment like?</li>
<li>Is Moose used? OO?</li>
</ul>


<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is there any allowance for remote work?</li>
<li>Are there core business hours?</li>
<li>Will I be oncall?</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Instant answers are those little boxes at the top of the DuckDuckGo search
results page.  I made one for discovering international calling codes &mdash; or
dialing codes if you prefer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-singapore.png" width="700" height="424">
<img src="/images/for-posts/2014-02-28-down-under.png" width="700" height="424"></p>

<p>If you want to hack on DuckDuckGo and add your own instant answer its pretty
simple to <a href="http://duckduckhack.com">get started</a>.  You can use Vagrant and
VirtualBox to get a complete working dev environment.  But if you are already
running Ubuntu or OSX the following recipe is easier:</p>

<pre><code>curl http://duckpan.org/install.pl | perl 
cpanm App::DuckPAN
duckpan installdeps # installs dependencies from DuckPAN (not CPAN) to locallib
</code></pre>

<p>Next fork the repository you want to hack on.  To choose the correct repository
think about what kind of data source you are using to generate your instant answer.</p>

<ul>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice">spice repo</a>
 if you have a real time data source like a JSON web API.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodie">goodie repo</a>
 if you generate your instant answer with code and need no network access.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">fathead repo</a>
 if your data source can be placed in a key/value store.</li>
<li> Fork the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead">longtail repo</a>
 if your data source requires a full text search.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now you can start hacking.  I&rsquo;ll show you how the capitalization instant answer
from the goodie repo works.  Below is the code.  I added comments to explain
things a bit.</p>

<pre><code>package DDG::Goodie::Capitalize;
use DDG::Goodie;

# If a DuckDuckGo search query contains any of these words at the start or
# end of the query, the 'remainder' handler below will run.
triggers startend =&gt; 'capitalize', 'uppercase', 'upper case';

# This block of code is pretty much meta data describing this instant
# answer.  Mostly it is used by https://duckduckgo.com/goodies.
zci answer_type =&gt; "capitalize";
primary_example_queries 'capitalize this';
secondary_example_queries 'uppercase that';
description 'capitalize a string';
name 'Capitalize';
code_url 'https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/Capitalize.pm';
category 'conversions';
topics 'programming';
attribution twitter =&gt; 'crazedpsyc',
            cpan    =&gt; 'CRZEDPSYC' ;

# This is is where the magic happens.  $_ contains the query minus the
# trigger word.  The return value from this sub shows up on the DuckDuckGo
# search results page as an instant answer.
handle remainder =&gt; sub { uc ($_) };
</code></pre>

<p>To test your new instant answer you can launch a little web server with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>duckpan server
</code></pre>

<p>Then open your favorite web browser and surf to
<a href="http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs">http://0:5000/?q=capitalize+aliens+smell+better+than+dinosaurs</a> and you should
see something like this:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently Ovid pointed out <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/01/ditching-a-language.html">large projects are much more likely to fail</a>.
I have a few large goals I&rsquo;d like to accomplish.  For example I want to improve
my front end design skills.  Rather than trying to tackle this problem all
at once, I made up a small project for myself.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="http://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html">Readline cheat sheet</a> and
I was able to complete this project in about a day.  Here are some
of the things I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> &ndash; I always worry libraries and frameworks like
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> are overkill and bloat since I only need
a tiny portion of their features.  But its undeniable that I was able to quickly
build a responsive mobile friendly website without needing to worry about the
technical details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Readline commands</strong> &ndash; If I had to pick one keyboad shortcut to recommend it
would be <code>Ctrl-r</code> which allows you to search backwards through your
history.  I also like the incremental undo command: <code>Ctrl-_</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Text::Xslate</strong> &ndash; People keep mentioning
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate">Text::Xslate</a> so I wanted to give it a try.
The docs say its full featured and very fast.  I liked that HTML metacharacters
are escaped by default to avoid cross site scripting attacks.  Also it supports
Template Toolkit syntax.  I didn&rsquo;t find any new killer features, but it was a
pleasure to work with.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Some new <a href="http://helabs.com.br/blog/2014/01/21/prevent-common-problems-when-writing-css-from-scratch/">CSS tricks</a></strong> &ndash;
The best trick I learned is how to keep my footer at the bottom of the page
even when it has only a few lines of content.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I was able to practice design, layout, color, and font selection.  And who
knows &mdash; perhaps this project will also drive a tiny bit of traffic to my
github profile and increase my
<a href="http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">luck surface area</a>.</p>

<p>The momentum feels good.  I need to remember to keep my projects small more often.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For years I have been hearing people say sugar is the new bad thing.  So I
finally got around to reading up on this claim.  Here is what I learned.</p>

<h1>Nutrition</h1>

<p>Food is composed of <strong>carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water, vitamins,</strong> and
<strong>minerals</strong>.  Of course, I sometimes swallow stuff that is not on that list
but the list is comprehensive in the sense that it covers everything my body
needs.  Notice that sugar is not in the list.  My body breaks down carbs and
fats into glucose (sugar) which can be used by my body as energy.</p>

<p>This means sugar has <em>zero</em> nutritional value.  There is no reason to ever
eat any.  Humans do not require sugar.</p>

<p>I have always been smug about the fact that I don&rsquo;t throw away my money on a
caffeine addiction.  But suddenly I realize I have been foolishly spending my
money on sugar.</p>

<h1>No dessert forever</h1>

<p>As part of my long term plan to someday somehow acquire a svelte physique, I
hereby <strong>reject and repudiate</strong> the harmful cultural ritual known as dessert.
The rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>No dessert forever.  No ice cream, no cake, no pie.</li>
<li>No candy forever.  No free candy or chocolate from the nice people at the office.</li>
<li>No fruit juice forever.</li>
<li>Exceptions

<ul>
<li>85%+ dark chocolate</li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Small quantities of desserts that I have never had before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
