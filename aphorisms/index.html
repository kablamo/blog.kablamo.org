<p>To win at chess: be perfect.  In chess, there is always a right answer and a
wrong answer.  I can compute a perfect game if I&rsquo;m smart enough and I do enough
calculations.</p>
<p>In poker, where randomness is built into the game, its not about being perfect.
Its about being consistent.</p>
<p>Poker players don&rsquo;t win in a single hand.  They don&rsquo;t win by risking it all on
a single big bet.  They consistently make lots of small every day decisions
correctly again and again.  They don&rsquo;t need to be perfect.  Even if they play
every hand &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo; they will still lose at times.</p>
<p>Doing the small things right is hard and requires analysis, self awareness,
emotional control, practice, and experience.  Its rare that a newcomer with no
experience starts playing poker and immediately wins big.  And even if they do,
they soon lose it all.</p>
