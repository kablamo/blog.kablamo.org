Go has a function called `defer()`.  Perl has a similar concept called a
**guard**.  Its pretty cool.  

Here is an example with a problem:

    sub get_data {
        return get_cached_data() || get_fresh_data();
    }

The problem is that `get_fresh_data()` won't get called if `get_cached_data()`
dies.  The traditional solution is to use `eval()`:

    sub get_data {
        my $results = eval { get_cached_data() };
        return get_fresh_data() if $@;
        return get_cached_data();
    }
