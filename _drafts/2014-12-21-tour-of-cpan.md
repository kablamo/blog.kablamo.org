Matt Trout created a fantastic opinionated tour of CPAN.  I think its brilliant
and useful.  Here is my summary whereby I remove all of the charm and wisdom
and to create a tldr with links:

**[Web Frameworks](http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/mstpan-1)**

 - CGI (the CPAN module): Run away
 - Catalyst: Venerable
 - Dancer: Good
 - Mojolicious: Pretty

**[Web Deployment]()**

 - mod_perl: Run away
 - Apache + FastCgiExternalServer: Good
 - Nginx + Starman + Unix socket: Good
 - Mojolicious + Hypnotoad: Good
