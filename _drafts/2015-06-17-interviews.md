Hiring someone after 2 interviews is a strange tradition.  Its like getting
married after two dates.  It can be a big decision based on not much
information -- especially if it means moving or buying a new house.  On any
given week I probably spend more time trying to make my boss happy than I do
waking hours with my wife.

# Decrease the cost of commitment

One way to decrease the cost of commitment is to work as a contractor first --
perhaps part time if that makes sense.  Another option is to find jobs that are
work-from-home so that you don't have move or put the kids in a new school.  I
also try to improve my chances by applying for jobs where the person I'm
working for is someone with a great reputation.

# If I was only allowed 2 dates before marriage 

**If I was only allowed 2 dates before marriage** I would ask lots of questions.
Similarly I have a big list of questions when I go into a job interview.  I
make sure to ask my questions first so I know what the interviewer is
looking for and don't waste time on irrelevant anecdotes.

**If I was only allowed 2 dates before marriage** I would set expectations.
Similarly, in a job interview I try to be clear about what I want and to
understand exactly what the potenetial employer wants.  An interview is not
just about them evaluating me.  I need to evaluate them.  Is this person
someone I want to spend huge amounts of time with?  A marriage is a voluntary
partnership and so is a job.

# Finding my dream job

No job is a dream job.  Going into an interview with stars in my eyes is
not a good negotiating position and sets up unrealistic expectations.  Just
like every relationship has real problems, so does every job.  My goal is to
Figure out what they are during the interview.  One good way to figure that out
Is to ask.  Some good questions are:

  * What do you wish you had known before taking this job?  
  * What is the worst thing about this job? 
  * What is the coolest thing you have done at this job?

# Stress

Interviews are not stressful if you practice and have a direct honest
conversation.  Do them often.  If you mess up this one, there is always the
next one.  If you only do one every ten years then its really really stressful
and there will be a lot riding on it.
