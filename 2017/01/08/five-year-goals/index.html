    <p>Maybe writing about my long term goals occasionally will help me think through
them and commit to them.</p>

<p>I currently group my goals into 4 major categories. I try to re-evaluate them
frequently.  Which means they change.  I try to look at them every day so they
are top of mind and I don’t get off track.</p>

<p>To achieve these goals I need to break them down into smaller and smaller
chunks until I find a chunk thats easy to do.  Basically its just a matter of
solving problems until all the problems are gone and I reach my goal.
Prioritization, measuring progress, and not getting stuck are important too.</p>

<h1 id="financial-independence">Financial independence</h1>

<p>I want to be financially independent by 2020.  Which means I need to save
enough money that I can live off the investment returns.</p>

<p>Some clarification: Its not my goal to sit around and do nothing.   And I’m
not necessarily going to quit my job.  My job is amazing, my coworkers are
brilliant, I’m learning a lot, and our product is both cool and useful.</p>

<p>The purpose is to have the freedom to do what I want.  And to know with
certainty I’m doing what I want.  And to be able to protect my family from risk
and change more easily.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways to generate wealth. I will need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keep expenses low</li>
  <li>Keep income high</li>
  <li>Invest wisely</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="good-health">Good health</h1>

<p>Life is good.  I want to live forever. Failing that I’d like to live as long as
possible with a high quality of life.</p>

<p>Basic goals</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eat well</li>
  <li>Sleep a lot</li>
  <li>Healthy teeth</li>
  <li>Weight under 155</li>
  <li>Aerobic:  Run 3 miles every day</li>
  <li>Strength: 100 pushups every day</li>
  <li>Strength:  20 pullups every day</li>
</ul>

<p>Stretch goals</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strength: handstand</li>
  <li>Body fat: 6 pack</li>
  <li>Endurance: marathon</li>
</ul>

<p>The fitness goals seem fairly simple to achieve but require quite a bit of
time.  The hard part for me is avoiding injury.  Diet is a harder problem.  I
eat pretty well.  Doing better here might require asking some experts and/or
just doing more research.</p>

<h1 id="better-relationships">Better relationships</h1>

<p>I want:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Friends who live in my neighborhood</li>
  <li>To see everyone in my family at least once a year</li>
  <li>To visit friends who are spread around the world once a year</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m an introvert, I work too much, and I have a 1 year old.  So I
suck at relationships.  Tribes are helpful and fun.  One of the big advantages
to financial independence is having the money and time to spend with friends
and family.</p>

<p>I believe that like anything else I can do better through analysis, planning,
and practice.  I have some ideas, but exactly what I’m going to do needs to be
fleshed out more.</p>

<h1 id="awesome-kids">Awesome kids</h1>

<p>I’d have tons of kids if I had tons of money and time.  Atm having more kids
sounds like a terrifying amount of work.  But I also think its one of the most
rewarding things a person can do and I especially think its going to be totally
worth it when I’m old.  This objective is woefully non specific atm and needs a
lot of work.</p>
