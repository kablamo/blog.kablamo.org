  * **So I can start kicking butt faster** - When I start a new job or a new
    contract. Or when I hack on a new feature.  Or every day of my life as a
    programmer that involves legacy code.  Yeah pretty much all the time.
  * **So I can learn new tricks** - Healthy languages evolve.  Idioms and slang
    are tools for more efficiently expressing ideas.  I want to be on top of
    that.  Also its best way to peak inside the mind of a talented developer and
    steal and copy their skills.
  * **So I can work better with others** - I understand their idioms because I have
    seen them before.  And I can probably articulate why their idioms are awesome
    or feeble.

I must remember that attitude matters.  If I think of reading code as a painful
chore it will be.  But if I look for opportunity I find it.
