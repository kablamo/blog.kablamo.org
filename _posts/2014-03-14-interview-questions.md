I recently relocated from London to the Chicago area so I have been doing
interviews.  When I interview a potential client or employer I carry this list of
questions with me.  Most of the questions I have taken from other sources
online.  I have listed them in roughly the order I ask them.

# Understanding the job

  - What will I be doing every day (precisely)?
  - Why are you hiring? New product? Scaling? Someone quit?
  - Who will I report to?
  - Who will I be working with?  How big are the teams?
  - What are my boss' goals for the next 6 months/year?
  - What is the key metric for the company? For my group? For my boss?

# Understanding the culture

  - How do you build software?  Where do requirements and features come from?
    Is it a very formal process or is there no process?
  - What problems does the group have that need to be solved?
  - Is there a mandate to fix legacy code and problems that exist?
  - What do you wish you had known before starting work here?
  - Whats the worst part of this job and whats the coolest thing you have built here, personally?

# Tools and best practices

  - What tools are being used?
    - bug tracking
    - version control
    - which version of Perl
    - what operating system
    - why were those choices made
  - Is there a mandate to use the latest stuff from CPAN?
  - Are there tests?
  - Are there automated tests?
  - What is deployment like?
  - Is Moose used? OO?

# Miscellaneous

  - Is there any allowance for remote work?
  - Are there core business hours?
  - Will I be oncall?
