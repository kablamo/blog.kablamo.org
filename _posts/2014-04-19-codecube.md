[Codecube.io](http://codecube.io) is a jsfiddle type service which runs Perl
code (and other languages) and shows the results in your browser.

The website is written in Go and runs your code inside a Docker container.  It
originally had support for C, Go, Python, and Ruby.  I was looking for an
excuse to play with Docker and Go so I submitted a pull request which added
support for Perl.
