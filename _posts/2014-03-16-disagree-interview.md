Today I'm writing about something I noticed while doing interviews recently.

If I disagree with a decision a company made, I need to jump into that with
both feet.  There is sometimes an instinct to say "I suppose I can live with
that" or "I don't know enough about why this choice was made to complain about
it".  But the goal is not to complain or to highlight their ignorance or to
have an argument.

Disagreeing starts a discussion.  This creates an opportunity to do 2 things.

First, it allows me to show case what I know.  The fact I have an opinion shows
I have worked on this problem before and over the course of the discussion I
will be able to demonstrate I understand the pros and cons of the different
options and have expertise there.  

Second, I will come to understand why the company got into the position they
are in.  Usually there is a good reason.  If it was made through ignorance I
will find out if are they open to fixing the problem -- subject to priorities
of course.  I may also learn if they are interested in my opinion or are
looking for a soldier who follows orders.
