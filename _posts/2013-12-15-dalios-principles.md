I have been reading Ray Dalio's _Principles_.  Ray Dalio is the CEO of
Bridgewater which is a big famous successful hedge fund he started in the 70's.
_Principles_, is a 123 page philosophical text he published in 2011 about how
to live your life and how to manage people and organizations.  Its extremely
good.  I'm not done yet but I have a feeling it is something I'm going to be
rereading many times over the next few years.  You can download it from the 
[Bridewater website](http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf).

Here is a sample:  

> Most people react to pain badly. They have “fight or flight” reactions to it:
> they either strike out at whatever brought them the pain or they try to run
> away from it. As a result, they don’t learn to find ways around their barriers,
> so they encounter them over and over again and make little or no progress
> toward what they want...
> 
> Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel the pain if you approach it correctly,
> because it will signal that you need to find solutions and to progress. Since
> the only way you are going to find solutions to painful problems is by thinking
> deeply about them - i.e., reflecting - if you can develop a knee-jerk reaction
> to pain that is to reflect rather than to fight or flee, it will lead to your
> rapid learning/evolving.

And from that he derives this equation:

> Pain + Reflection = Progress

So I've been trying to do this.  Whenever I experience conflict, stress, anger,
or pain, I will try to make that into an opportunity to evolve and to become
stronger.

Quite a lot of _Principles_ feels like common sense.  But at the same time I
can see that some of that common sense stuff is stuff I haven't been doing or
have been doing half way or just have not thought through as much as Dalio has.
I think that having this set of considered formalized principles to refer
to will help me to get what I want from life.

By the way, I discovered _Principles_ via 
[Sebastian Marshall](http://sebastianmarshall.com/).  Sebastion is an American
who has been living and working in Japan for about 10 years.  His writing is
always interesting and is a great source of new ideas for me.
