    <p>Recently Ovid pointed out <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/01/ditching-a-language.html">large projects are much more likely to fail</a>.
I have a few large goals I’d like to accomplish.  For example I want to improve
my front end design skills.  Rather than trying to tackle this problem all
at once, I made up a small project for myself.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="http://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html">Readline cheat sheet</a> and
I was able to complete this project in about a day.  Here are some
of the things I learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> - I always worry libraries and frameworks like
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> are overkill and bloat since I only need
a tiny portion of their features.  But its undeniable that I was able to quickly
build a responsive mobile friendly website without needing to worry about the
technical details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Readline commands</strong> - If I had to pick one keyboad shortcut to recommend it
would be <code>Ctrl-r</code> which allows you to search backwards through your
history.  I also like the incremental undo command: <code>Ctrl-\_</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Text::Xslate</strong> - People keep mentioning
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Xslate">Text::Xslate</a> so I wanted to give it a try.
The docs say its full featured and very fast.  I liked that HTML metacharacters
are escaped by default to avoid cross site scripting attacks.  Also it supports
Template Toolkit syntax.  I didn’t find any new killer features, but it was a
pleasure to work with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Some new <a href="http://helabs.com.br/blog/2014/01/21/prevent-common-problems-when-writing-css-from-scratch/">CSS tricks</a></strong> -
The best trick I learned is how to keep my footer at the bottom of the page
even when it has only a few lines of content.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to practice design, layout, color, and font selection.  And who
knows – perhaps this project will also drive a tiny bit of traffic to my
github profile and increase my
<a href="http://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">luck surface area</a>.</p>

<p>The momentum feels good.  I need to remember to keep my projects small more often.</p>
